Gavin Newsom's sweeping, $4.7 billion program to address a youth mental health crisis.Spearheaded by the county's Medi-Cal plans \u2014 which provide health insurance to low-income residents \u2014 in collaboration with its Office of Education and Department of Mental Health, the LA school program relies on teletherapy services provided by Hazel Health, one of a clutch of companies that have sprung up to address a nationwide shortage of mental health services that grew much worse during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe teletherapy effort is one of four LA County projects that will collectively receive up to $83 million from the state's \nStudent Behavioral Health Incentive Program\n, one component of the Democratic governor's 'master plan' to address gaps in youth mental health care access.\nLA's Hazel Health contract is aimed at helping overburdened schools cope with a surge in demand for mental health services. It promises to be a telling case study in both the efficacy of virtual therapy for students and the ability of educators and administrators to effectively manage a sprawling and sensitive program in partnership with a for-profit company.For some Los Angeles County educators and families, the initial results are promising.Anjelah Salazar, 10, said her Hazel clinician has helped her feel a lot better. After the fifth grader switched to a new school this year, Stanton Elementary in Glendora, she started having panic attacks every day.\nHer mom, Rosanna Chavira, said she didn't know what to do \u2014 even though she's a clinical coordinator for a company that treats mental health conditions \u2014 and worried she wouldn't be able to find an affordable therapist who accepted their insurance. Once Chavira learned about Hazel, she jumped at the opportunity.'This being free and having a licensed professional teaching her coping skills, it just means the world,' Chavira said. 'You can already see changes.'Salazar said she's met with her virtual therapist five times so far. One coping technique that she especially appreciates is a tapping exercise: Every night before bed, she taps her eyes, her cheeks, her chest, and her knees. With each tap, she recites the same affirmation: 'I am brave.'Christine Crone, parent of seventh grader Brady, said she has yet to see if the sessions have been effective for her son, who attends Arroyo Seco Junior High in Santa Clarita, but she knows he enjoys them.'He struggles normally with being on time and prepared, but with these sessions, he always stops what he is doing and makes sure he is logged in on time,' Crone said. 'He says that his therapist is nice, fun, and easy to talk to.'Jennifer Moya, a mental health counselor at Martha Baldwin Elementary in Alhambra, a city east of Los Angeles, said her students like the flexibility of teletherapy, which allows them to meet with clinicians anytime between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.'This generation of kids has grown up digital,' said Moya, who is in charge of referring students to Hazel at her school. 'They love that this is easy.'Pablo Isais, a mental health counselor at Alhambra's Granada Elementary School, said the services can also be a stopgap while a student waits for an in-person appointment, which can take six to eight weeks.'To be able to let them know that there are services available that they can access within the next week is amazing,' Moya said.Thus far, early in the rollout, only 607 Los Angeles County students have participated in Hazel sessions since they were first offered, in Compton, in December 2022, said Alicia Garoupa, chief of well-being and support services for the Office of Education. She acknowledged some bumps in the rollout but said Hazel is 'another tool in our toolbox.'\nSTATE RELIES ON FOR-PROFIT VENTURES\nTeletherapy is playing an increasingly important role in schools across the nation as educators and social workers face pressure to address growing mental health issues. According to an \nApril Chalkbeat report\n, 13 of the nation's 20 largest school districts, including Los Angeles Unified, have added teletherapy since the pandemic began.LA County's deal with Hazel calls for the company to be paid up to $20 million through the end of 2024. In addition, Hazel can bill students' insurance.The San Francisco-based company, founded in 2015, has raised $112.5 million from investors and has contracts in 15 different states. Other companies chasing youth mental health dollars include another San Francisco startup, Daybreak Health, a graduate of the prestigious Y Combinator tech incubator, along with BeMe, Brightline, and Kooth.California chose Brightline and Kooth for a 2024 $532 million statewide initiative on virtual youth behavioral services, another important component of Newsom's master plan. There is some overlap between the state and local programs, Brightline co-founder and CEO Naomi Allen acknowledged, but she said the Brightline offering is broader than what Hazel is doing in schools, with services including everything from coaching sessions for caregivers to meditation resources.'The state is funding free access to services for every child in the state, which is just a remarkably ambitious program,' said Allen.\nStill, many questions remain about the efficacy of teletherapy for students. It's also proving to be no surefire moneymaker for the companies thus far: Brightline laid off \n20 percent of its staff\n last spring, the second round of layoffs in six months.\nSUPPLEMENT, NOT SOLUTION\nChelsy Duffer-Dunbar, who at the time worked for Los Angeles Unified as a psychiatric social worker, told KFF Health News in October that she hadn't yet worked with Hazel, but noted that the county requires that a member of staff stay within eyesight of the student during their appointments and assist if tech issues arise.'It is still taking up staff time,' Duffer-Dunbar said. 'My day is already so stressful. I can't imagine having a threat assessment and a suicide assessment at work and then trying to scramble around to find someone to sit in on this therapy session with the kiddo and their iPad.'Duffer-Dunbar said she wants the district to prioritize in-person clinicians who are immersed in the local community, especially for younger kids who have trouble engaging with teletherapy.Duffer-Dunbar has since left the district in response to budget cuts that forced her into a more burdensome role.Hazel emphasized that teletherapy is not a one-size-fits-all solution.'It's an opportunity to expand access,' said Andrew Post, chief of innovation at the company.\nEDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE WORKING TOGETHER\nIt took a complicated collaboration between school districts, county agencies, and the two Medi-Cal plans, L.A. Care Health Plan and Health Net, to set up the school therapy program. The state funding rules were designed to push the entities to work together.'This program has helped us get closer to school districts,' said Michael Brodsky, senior medical director for community health at L.A. Care Health Plan. 'If we can catch kids while they're at school and refer them to get treatment while they're in school, that's good.'Hazel provides primarily short-term one-to-one therapy sessions with clinical social workers or other licensed counselors, 40 percent of whom are bilingual. They are best suited to provide temporary support to those with mild to moderate needs, such as students struggling with academic stress or starting at a new school, but they can also make referrals for long-term care.The largest district enrolled in the program, Los Angeles Unified, accounts for 41 percent of the county's students, but not all districts are ready to take the leap. Four in 10 districts have opted to not offer Hazel's services, which Garoupa attributes partially to data-sharing concerns.The contract with Hazel ends in December 2024, but Garoupa said the Office of Education and its partners intend to maintain services through June 2025. Any extension beyond that will depend on the results.Sonya Smith, a colleague of Garoupa's, said the Office of Education will be continuously evaluating Hazel's effectiveness through an annual survey, monthly impact reports, and weekly meetings.'The number of students that are using Hazel is obviously going to be a key metric,' Smith said. 'Hazel's historic utilization rate is 3 percent to 8 percent. We'll be evaluating if those numbers hold up, if students are accessing care in a timely manner, and if it's lightening the burden for school staff and community-based providers.'\nThis article was produced by\u00a0KFF Health News, which publishes\u00a0California Healthline, an editorially independent service of the\u00a0California Health Care Foundation.\n(KFF Health News, formerly known as Kaiser Health News (KHN), is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs of \nKFF\u00a0\n\u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling and journalism.)\n\u00a92023 KFF Health News.

From having cutting-edge facilities and renowned medical professionals to a unique blend of cultural experiences, it is no wonder that the country has been propelled to the forefront of global healthcare destinations. At the forefront of this medical renaissance is Acibadem Health Point, a pioneering healthcare institution that has played a pivotal role in shaping Turkey's reputation as a premier destination for health tourism.\u00a0\nAcibadem Health Point\n, the premier international patient center in Turkey, is making waves in the global healthcare arena thanks to its exceptional services and state-of-the-art facilities. As a part of the Acibadem Group, which boasts 24 JCI-accredited hospitals and 16 outpatient clinics, Acibadem Health Point is redefining the healthcare experience for medical tourists seeking specialized treatments in Turkey.\nAcibadem Group's Centers of Excellence cater to a wide range of health conditions, including cancer, heart disease, organ transplantation, IVF, obesity, plastic surgery, and more. With 11 cancer centers, 16 healthcare centers, 14 in-vitro fertilization centers, 10 organ transplantation centers, 10 spine centers, 3 sports medicine centers accredited by FIFA, and 6 robotic surgery centers, Acibadem stands out nationally and internationally for its advanced technology equipment and experienced experts.\nMost importantly, all 24 hospitals and 16 outpatient clinics within the \nAcibadem Group\n meet global standards of quality and safety in healthcare. In addition, the Joint Commission International (JCI) accreditation underscores the commitment to providing world-class medical services, ensuring that patients receive top-notch care in a secure environment.\nIndeed, what began as a small neighborhood hospital in Istanbul has now evolved into a global healthcare leader. Acibadem's rapid growth led to a strategic joint partnership with IHH Healthcare in 2012, enabling the group to become part of the world's second-largest healthcare chain. This collaboration has further strengthened Acibadem's position in the international healthcare landscape.\nAcibadem Health Point goes beyond medical treatment, however, as it offers a range of patient support services. From free consultations to airport pick-up, 24-hour assistance, accommodation, online doctor consultations, and personal interpreters, the group ensures that international patients feel supported throughout their healthcare journey in Turkey.\nFrom the moment patients arrive at Istanbul Airport until they return to their home countries, the Acibadem team is dedicated to providing unparalleled support. The \nAcibadem Health Point\n lounge at the airport exemplifies this commitment, offering free internet services for international patients while they await transportation to their hospital or hotel. Patients also benefit from personal interpreters and exclusive discounts on various services and treatments, enhancing their overall experience.\nMoreover, patients can readily take advantage of Turkey's appeal which extends beyond medical treatments, offering a unique blend of cultural experiences for medical tourists. From the historic allure of Istanbul to the natural wonders of Cappadocia, patients can immerse themselves in a rich tapestry of cultural experiences while undergoing treatments, making the healthcare journey a holistic and enriching experience.\nAs Turkey solidifies its position as a premier global hub for medical tourism, institutions such as the Acibadem Group stand out as leaders in providing a comprehensive healthcare experience. Consequently, it is evident that Acibadem Health Point will persist in offering exceptional medical services, serving as a centralized international patient center within the Acibadem Group. With a dedicated emphasis on excellence, cutting-edge technology, and patient-centered care, it's unsurprising that Acibadem Health Point has emerged as a preferred destination for international patients seeking top-notch medical treatments on a global scale.\nFor more information, please visit www.acibademhealthpoint.com.\nContact Info: Name: ACIBADEM Health Point\nEmail: \nSend Email\nOrganization: ACIBADEM Health Point\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.acibademhealthpoint.com/", "rights": "asiaone.com", "rank": 4002, "topic": "business", "country": "SG", "language": "en", "authors": "Turkey", "media": "https://storage.googleapis.com/mmstudio-images/gallery/WeraP7i62sgexGIFNwzD88Tp1ko2/1702976930605-0.png", "is_opinion": false, "twitter_account": "@asiaonecom", "_score": 5.5997086, "_id": "ab9f873f961c128605681fe82f47aa1a"}, {"title": "Interest in para-counselling courses still strong even after pandemic: Training providers", "author": "Claudia Lim", "published_date": "2023-12-21 14:33:08", "published_date_precision": "full", "link": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/watch/interest-para-counselling-courses-still-strong-even-after-pandemic-training-providers-video-4004856", "clean_url": "channelnewsasia.com", "excerpt": "Academies say courses that teach how to provide mental health support to peers remain popular as people find such skills useful in a variety of settings.

But recent research has called this into question.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nScan the dairy case of any grocery store, and you'll find rows upon rows of products with varying levels of fat. Nonfat, low-fat, whole: What's the healthiest option?\n \nIf you consult the \nUS dietary guidelines\n or health authorities like the \nAmerican Heart Association\n or the \nWorld Health Organization\n, the answer is clear: Choose a fat-free or low-fat version.\n \nThis recommendation stems from the idea that full-fat dairy products are high in saturated fats, so choosing lower-fat versions can reduce your risk of heart disease, said Dr Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at Tufts University.\n \nBut that guidance goes back to 1980, when the first edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans was published, he said. And since then, most studies on the health effects of dairy fat have failed to find any benefits of prioritising low-fat versions over whole, Dr Mozaffarian said.\n \nWhat seems to be more important than the level of fat, he added, is which dairy product you choose in the first place.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nWHAT THE RESEARCH SUGGESTS\n \nIn studies that have surveyed people about their diets and then tracked their health over many years, researchers have found associations between dairy consumption and lower risks of certain conditions, such as \nhigh blood pressure, cardiovascular disease\n and \nType 2 \ndiabetes\n, Dr Mozaffarian said.\n \nSuch benefits, he added, were often present regardless of whether people chose reduced-fat or full-fat yoghurt, cheese or milk. And though full-fat dairy products are higher in calories, \nstudies\n have found that those who consume them aren't more likely to gain weight.\n \nIn \none study published in 2018\n, for example, researchers followed 136,000 adults from 21 countries for nine years. They found that, during the study period, those who consumed two or more servings of dairy per day were 22 per cent less likely to develop cardiovascular disease and 17 per cent less likely to die than those who consumed no dairy at all. Notably, those who consumed higher levels of saturated fat from dairy were not more likely to develop heart disease or die.\n \nIn another large analysis, \nalso published in 2018\n, researchers pooled the results from 16 studies involving more than 63,000 adults. They found that, across an average of nine years, those who had higher levels of dairy fats in their blood were 29 per cent less likely than those with lower levels to develop Type 2 diabetes.\n \nThis finding suggests that there may be a benefit to consuming dairy fat rather than avoiding it, Dr Mozaffarian said.\n \nOf course, these studies can't prove that dairy products themselves reduce certain risks of disease. That would require long-term clinical trials, which haven't been conducted, Dr Mozaffarian said. But \nshorter-term trials\n have shown that consuming dairy products, including \nfull-fat dairy\n, lowered the blood pressure of participants and did not increase weight or raise levels of LDL, or 'bad cholesterol'\n\u00a0\u2013 \nagain suggesting that dairy fat is not harmful to heart health.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n (Photo: The New York Times/Bobbi Lin) \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nWHY DAIRY FATS COULD BE GOOD FOR YOU\n \nThere are several possible explanations for why dairy fats may not be as harmful as previously thought\n\u00a0\u2013 \nand may even be healthful, said Dr Ronald Krauss, a professor of paediatrics and medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.\n \nAmong the various types of saturated fats that can be found in foods, dairy products contain certain ones that appear to be neutral or beneficial for health, Dr Krauss said, including those linked to reduced risks of \nType 2 diabetes\n and \ncoronary heart disease\n.\n \nMilk fat is also naturally packaged in a unique structure called the milk fat globule membrane, said Marie-Caroline Michalski, a research director at the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment. Components of this structure can help bind cholesterol in the digestive tract, \npotentially improving blood cholesterol levels\n.\n \nIt's also becoming clear that certain types of dairy foods may be \nbetter\n for you\n than others, Dr Michalski said.\n \nYoghurt\n and \ncheese\n, for instance, appear to be most associated with health benefits. This may be because both are fermented foods, Dr Michalski said, which can supply good bacteria to \nyour gut\n. They also contain other \nbeneficial molecules\n made during fermentation, including Vitamin K, which is linked to \nheart health\n, Dr Mozaffarian said.\n \nHarder cheeses like cheddar and parmesan also seem to result in a more \ngradual absorption of fats into the blood\n than softer cheeses and butter, which can help you feel fuller longer, Dr Michalski said.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nADVICE FOR THE DAIRY AISLE\n \nPenny Kris-Etherton, a professor emeritus of nutritional sciences at Pennsylvania State University, said an independent panel of nutrition experts is currently reviewing \nthe evidence\n on how saturated fat consumption affects cardiovascular disease risk. And that could lead to upcoming changes to dairy food recommendations in the United States, she said.\n \nUntil then, she thinks it's best to aim for three servings of dairy per day as part of a balanced diet, as is recommended by the current dietary guidelines. Based on the most recent dairy fat data, however, it's probably okay if one or two of those servings are whole-fat milk, yoghurt or cheese, she said, noting that more than that could add up to too many calories.\n \nDr Mozaffarian suggests incorporating at least one or two servings of yoghurtand cheese per day, given these foods' health benefits\n\u00a0\u2013 \npreferably unsweetened versions to avoid added sugar.\n \nAs for what fat content you should go for, 'choose whatever you like', Dr Mozaffarian said. Some \nstudies\n suggest that there may be a benefit of consuming full-fat dairy products, 'but I don't think the evidence is convincing enough yet to make that a dietary recommendation', he added.\n \nDr Michalski prefers eating plain, whole fat yoghurt; when you remove the natural fats, you lose some vitamins, such as Vitamins A and D, as well as the 'pleasure' and good texture, she said.\n \nInstead of butter, Dr Kris-Etherton encourages people to use plant-based oils like olive, canola or soya bean oils, or margarines made from the same oils.\n \nButter and cream do appear to raise \nblood cholesterol levels\n more than other sources of dairy fat, Dr Krauss said, and he recommends limiting them if you have high cholesterol.\n \nAnd while there's not good evidence that low-fat dairy products are a healthier choice for everyone, Dr Krauss said, people respond differently to different foods. If you have high blood cholesterol, he added, it's worth discussing your dairy choices with your doctor.\n \nBy Alice Callahan \u00a9 The New York Times Company\n \nThe article originally appeared in \nThe New York Times\n.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n Source: New York Times/mm", "rights": "channelnewsasia.com", "rank": 1591, "topic": "news", "country": "SG", "language": "en", "authors": "CNA Lifestyle", "media": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--plsLoxs_--/c_crop,h_1181,w_2100,x_0,y_8/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:nytimeswatermark,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2023/12/14/well_low_fat_dairy_products_dec13_1-1.jpg?itok=L6EUc0hX", "is_opinion": false, "twitter_account": "@ChannelNewsAsia", "_score": 5.184581, "_id": "d7e7d89b8a42a3d724519858e5f08102"}, {"title": "APEC Introduces Policy Toolkit to Build Demographic Resiliency", "author": "", "published_date": "2023-12-20 23:00:00", "published_date_precision": "timezone unknown", "link": "https://www.apec.org/press/news-releases/2023/apec-introduces-policy-toolkit-to-build-demographic-resiliency", "clean_url": "apec.org", "excerpt": "To prevent the long-term economic challenges posed by demographic change, APEC members through the Health Working Group, are introducing a set of policy recommendations that can assist economies in\u2026", "summary": "To prevent the long-term economic challenges posed by demographic change, APEC members through the\u00a0\nHealth Working Group\n, are introducing a set of policy recommendations that can assist economies in their effort to create an enabling environment for reproductive health decision-making.\n\n\nThese policy recommendations are in response to the long-term, negative economic challenges posed by demographic trends faced by most APEC member economies that include falling fertility rates, which directly impact dependency ratios and economic security, and higher unintended pregnancy rates, which directly impact women's economic participation.\n\n\n'Historically, efforts to expand access to family planning resources and services in APEC economies have had limited impact because they have largely been responsive to a single problem,' said Dr Narong Aphikulvanich, chair of the APEC Health Working Group.\u00a0\n\n\n'Understanding the inextricable link between demographics and economics, we have to look at this issue with a holistic lens and join forces with the private sector to bring new approaches to the table that will help address barriers from multiple angles to drive real, lasting change,' added Dr Aphikulvanich.\n\n\nThe publication, '\nAPEC Smart Families Menu of Policy Options for Demographic Resilience\n,'\n\u00a0part of the APEC Smart Families initiative launched last year, is designed around three pillars: 1) reproductive health & health literacy; 2) labor and economics; and 3) funding & financing mechanisms. It identifies barriers in each pillar and lays out policy recommendations with real examples for implementing policy from across the region.\u00a0\n\n\n'While many of the recommendations listed in the menu of policy options could be implemented in isolation, creating an enabling environment requires a multipronged approach that addresses barriers from multiple angles,' Dr Aphikulvanich said.\n\n\nThe menu of policy options highlights the need for data collection as it has a critical role in identifying the reason behind falling birth rates or persistent rates of unintended pregnancy, as well as in measuring the extent to which policies are effective.\n\n\nIt also emphasizes the tangible economic impacts when individuals and families have the tools to make the best reproductive decisions for themselves. As such, the menu of policy options is structured around a framework of demographic resilience; an approach to create an enabling environment that brings together family planning and fertility planning while at the same time maximizing economic opportunities.\u00a0\n\n\n'Our goal should be to create policies and an environment that respond to women's desire for safe, affordable family planning services and provide the support they need to raise and educate their children, unleashing their economic earning power', said Dr Leslie Mancuso, president and CEO of Jhpiego, a global health non-profit and partner of the initiative.\u00a0\n\n\n'Fundamental to achieving our shared vision of thriving families is our collective power to drive change, strengthen health care for all and create the conditions that advance economic prosperity across the region,' Dr Mancuso explained.\n\n\n'No single stakeholder can solve these demographic and economic barriers alone,' said Kevin Ali, CEO of Organon, a global healthcare company with a focus on women's health and the private sector partner of the initiative.\u00a0\n\n\n'That's why public-private partnerships and cross-sector collaboration is crucial in finding new approaches to help address these issues. We are proud to bring our expertise to the table, identifying sustainable solutions that empower women and help to eliminate barriers to family planning and fertility planning, so that women can achieve their full promise.'\n\n\nThe next phase of APEC Smart Families initiative will aim to convene several virtual workshops of policymakers and a multistakeholder expert group to identify innovative health financing mechanisms for sustainably implementing the menu of policy options.\n\n\nFor more information on the\u00a0menu of policy options,\n\u00a0\nplease visit the APEC Smart Families\u00a0\nwebsite\n.\n \nFor further details, please contact:\n\n\nMasyitha Baziad +65 9751 2146 at\u00a0\n[email\u00a0protected]\n\nMichael Chapnick +65 9647 4847 at\u00a0\n[email\u00a0protected]", "rights": "apec.org", "rank": 15229, "topic": "news", "country": "SG", "language": "en", "authors": "", "media": "https://www.apec.org/images/default-source/newsrelease/2023/new-website-thumbnail---2023-12-18t185332-129.png?sfvrsn=d8cd3ee3_0&puid=a58f4c8b-a2cb-4836-be10-de50b364e561", "is_opinion": false, "twitter_account": null, "_score": 5.1608806, "_id": "4e7f727d3aa812cfbbe744f896731a98"}, {"title": "Hospitals across India on alert after cases of new Covid variant found", "author": "The Statesman", "published_date": "2023-12-21 02:50:51", "published_date_precision": "full", "link": "https://asianews.network/hospitals-across-india-on-alert-after-cases-of-new-covid-variant-found", "clean_url": "asianews.network", "excerpt": "Hospitals across India on alert after cases of new Covid variant found Asia News Network (ANN) is the leading regional alliance of news titles striving to bring the region closer, through an active sharing of editorial content on happenings in the region.", "summary": "December 21, 2023\n\nNEW DELHI \u2013 Hospitals across India have been put on alert after multiple cases of Covid JN.1 variant were reported in several states even as experts allay fears of any major public health risk.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Centre said that a total of 21 cases of the new variant has been found in the country, including 19 from Goa and one each from Maharashtra and Kerala.\n\nIn Gujarat, there are 19 active cases of coronavirus and genome sequencing will be done to find their variant.\n\nIn view of the looming threat, mock drill was conducted in the state's 5,700 hospitals, including government and private, between December 13 and 17.\n\nEarlier today, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya held a high-level review meeting with state and union territory health ministers on the preparedness of health facilities and services in view of the recent surge in respiratory diseases like influenza and COVID-19.\n\nAfter the meeting, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde said that instructions have been given to the Health Department and necessary measures have been taken to ensure the situation does not increase.\n\n'We have taken the necessary measures regarding Corona.

They record whatever basic facts they can about the dead: name, identity card number, age, sex.\n \nSome of the bodies are badly mutilated. Only those that have been identified or claimed by relatives can go for burial and be included in the Gaza Health Ministry's death toll for the war. The rest are stored in the morgue's refrigerator, often for weeks.\n \nThe toll stood at around 20,000 people on Thursday (Dec 21), amid renewed international calls for a fresh ceasefire in Gaza. The ministry says thousands more dead remain buried beneath the rubble. About 70 per cent of those killed are women and children, it says.\n \nThe ministry's figures have drawn international attention to the high number of civilians being killed in the Israeli military's offencive, which it launched after Hamas' Oct 7 attack on Israel, the bloodiest in the country's 75 year history.\n \nBut with most hospitals across Gaza now closed, hundreds of doctors and other health workers killed, and communications hampered by lack of fuel and electricity, it's becoming increasingly difficult to compile the casualty figures.\n \nThe morgue workers at the Nasser Hospital are part of an international effort \u2014\u00a0including doctors and health officials in Gaza as well as academics, activists and volunteers around the world \u2014 to ensure the toll doesn't become a casualty of the increasingly dire conditions of the war.\n \nThe workers, some of them volunteers, do not have enough food or water for their families, but they keep going because recording the number of Palestinians dying matters to them, said Hamad Hassan Al Najjar.\n \nHe said the psychological toll of the work was immense. Holding a piece of white paper with handwritten information about one of the dead, the 42-year-old said he was often shocked to find the badly damaged corpse of a friend or relative brought in.\n \nThe body of the morgue's director, Saeed Al-Shorbaji, and those of several of his family members, arrived in early December, after they were killed in an Israeli airstrike, Al Najjar said.\n \n\"He was one of the pillars of this morgue,\" said Al Najjar, his face worn with sadness and fatigue. Preparing the bodies of dead children, some of them missing heads or limbs, was the most painful task: \"It takes you hours to recover your psychological balance, to recover from the effects of this shock.\"\n \nThe Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has expressed regret for civilian deaths but blamed Hamas \u2014 the Palestinian militant group that ran the Gaza Strip \u2014\u00a0for sheltering in densely populated areas. Hamas gunmen killed 1,200 people in the Oct 7 attack, most of them civilians, and seized some 240 hostages.\n \nIsrael says it will continue its offencive until Hamas is eliminated, the hostages returned and the threat of future attacks on Israel removed.\n \nAn Israeli military spokesperson said in response to a comment request for this article that the IDF \"follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm\".\n \n \nUN vouches for the data\n \nThe data recorded by Al Najjar and his colleagues is collated by workers at an information centre set up by the health ministry at the Nasser Hospital, in the city of Khan Younis. Ministry staff fled their offices at Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza after Israeli forces entered it in mid-November.\n \nMinistry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qidra, a 50-year-old doctor, reads the numbers at press conferences, or posts the figures on social media if communications are hampered by the hostilities. The head of the ministry's information centre did not respond to requests for comment.\n \nSince early December, the ministry has said it was unable to collect regular reports from morgues at hospitals in northern Gaza, amid the collapse of communications services and other infrastructure in Gaza due to the Israeli offencive.\n \nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), only six of Gaza's 36 hospitals were receiving casualties as of Wednesday, all of them in the south.\n \nThe WHO cited this as one reason it believes the ministry's tally may be an undercount; the toll also excludes dead who were never taken to hospitals or whose bodies were never recovered. The WHO and other experts said it was not possible for now to determine the extent of any undercounting.\n \nUS President Joe Biden said on Oct 25 he had \"no confidence\" in the Palestinian data. The ministry's figures say nothing about cause of death, and they don't distinguish between civilians and combatants.\n \nFollowing Biden's remark, the ministry released a 212-page report listing 7,028 people killed in the conflict until Oct 26, including identity cards, names, age and sex. Since then, the ministry has not released such detailed data, making it hard for researchers to corroborate the latest figures.\n \nHowever, the United Nations \u2014\u00a0which has long-standing co-operation with Palestinian health authorities \u2014\u00a0continues to vouch for the quality of the data. The WHO noted that \u2014\u00a0compared to previous conflicts in Gaza \u2014\u00a0the figures show more civilians have been killed, including a greater proportion of women and children.\n \nIsraeli officials this month said they believe the data released to date is broadly accurate; they have estimated that one third of those killed in Gaza are enemy combatants, without providing detailed figures.\n \nThe Palestinian Health Ministry, which is located in the occupied West Bank and pays the salaries of Gazan ministry workers, said it has lost almost all contact recently with hospitals in the enclave. It also has no information on the fate of several hundred health workers arrested by Israeli forces, it added.\n \nAsked about the arrests, the IDF said it had detained some hospital staff based on intelligence that Hamas was using medical facilities for its operations. Those not involved in these activities were released after questioning, it said, without providing the number of detainees.\n \nInternational efforts\n \n[[nid:663838]]\n \nAcademics, advocates and volunteers across Europe, the United States and India are working to analyse the data provided by the Gaza Health Ministry, to corroborate the details of those killed and determine the numbers of civilian casualties.\n \nMuch of this is based on the Oct 26 list that includes names, identity card numbers, and other details. Some other researchers, meanwhile, are \"scraping\" social media to preserve accounts posted there for future analysis.\n \n\"There are far more eyes and players involved in recording Gaza deaths than is normal and than exist in the world's other worst crises\", said Leslie Roberts, Professor Emeritus of Population and Family Health at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. Roberts has been involved in more than 50 mortality surveys during wars since the early 1990s.\n \nLondon-based Airwars \u2014\u00a0a non-profit affiliated with the department of media and communications at Goldsmiths, University of London, that investigates civilian deaths in conflicts \u2014\u00a0is using social media and the ministry's Oct 26 document to compile a detailed record of casualties.\n \nAirwars director Emily Tripp said some 20 volunteers were working on the project alongside regular staff, and so far it had positively identified some 900 civilians killed in the fighting. Even if the fighting stopped today, it could take another year to finish the survey, she said.\n \n\"What we're also seeing now is civilians who've been killed who are displaced from other areas, so they're not easily identified by their neighbours,\" Tripp told Reuters. \"That makes the process of counting and identification really challenging.\"\n \nZeina Jamaluddine, a doctoral student at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, co-authored an analysis last month in the Lancet medical journal based on the health ministry's Oct 26 list. The study concluded that the identification numbers of those listed as killed were highly correlated with age, a pattern unlikely to arise from data fabrication.\n \nShe said the Palestinian health authorities' systems for collecting data had been tested over multiple wars and revised through United Nations-backed efforts: \"While no data is 100 per cent perfect, Palestine has high quality data.\"\n \nWhile excess mortality experts have tools for calculating total deaths after conflicts end, there are challenges to doing so and the final post-war toll could end up being incomplete unless deaths are recorded to the greatest extent possible in real time, she said.\n \n\"Every name on the list represents a person, a life, a story. Each one deserves to be remembered.\"\n \nEntire families killed\n \nResearchers use methods such as surveys of households after a conflict is over to estimate the overall toll.\n \nHousehold surveys could be difficult following this conflict because in some cases entire families have been killed by bombardments \u2014sometimes dozens of members, according to the Oct 26 list. More than four-fifth of Gaza's pre-war population has fled their homes \u2014\u00a01.9 million people, according to UN figures \u2014\u00a0and may be difficult to locate, experts say.\n \nBut given how close-knit Gazan society is, there is hope that such studies could eventually be conducted in a meaningful way, said Hamit Dardagan of the Iraq Body Count (IBC), an organisation that records violent deaths resulting from the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq. The IBC has already published an analysis on age and other characteristics of those killed in Gaza, based on the ministry's Oct\u00a026 data.\n \n[[nid:663852]]\n \n\"The pace of civilian deaths \u2014\u00a0at least 200 each day since October 7, except for the week-long truce \u2014\u00a0is unprecedented this century, and was not seen at height of the Iraq invasion,\" Dardagan said.\n \nIt will take years to recover the remains of people from beneath the rubble, and the costly, technical process will not result in the identification of each body, said Dr Gilbert Burnham, a doctor and professor at Johns Hopkins University who has worked since the 1970s on humanitarian health problems in wars.\n \nIn addition to the dead, the ministry says there have been more than 52,500 people wounded in the conflict. The WHO points to the growing risk of disease due to a lack of clean water, food and medical attention.\n \nDr Ghassan Abu Sitta, a British-Palestinian surgeon who volunteered in two hospitals in northern Gaza for the first six weeks of the war, said some people were dying because of lack of treatment of open wounds.\n \n\"The death toll is a poor proxy of human suffering\", said Dr Annie Sparrow, a paediatrician who has worked with medics treating the wounded in the Syrian civil war for more than a decade and is an Associate Professor of Global Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.\n \nBut the use of records to fight the fear of erasure runs deep in Palestinian culture, said Abdel Razzaq Takriti, associate professor of Modern Arab History at Rice University in Texas. He quoted from a poem by prominent Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish: \"You will be forgotten as if you never were\".\n \nTakriti said many Palestinians see the Gaza war as part of a history of conflict and displacement by Israeli forces dating back to the Nakba \u2014\u00a0or catastrophe in Arabic \u2014 when more than 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes in what is now Israel during the war over the formation of the country in 1948.\n \n\"For the sake of the present, future, and the past, we need to have an accurate rendition of numbers,\" Takriti said.\n \nALSO READ:\u00a0\nHamas leader visits Egypt amid intensive talks on new ceasefire", "rights": "asiaone.com", "rank": 4002, "topic": "world", "country": "SG", "language": "en", "authors": "", "media": "https://media.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/styles/a1_600x316/public/original_images/Dec2023/1222_gazA_m.jpg?h=2e181f1f&itok=cwXRwCPi", "is_opinion": false, "twitter_account": "@asiaonecom", "_score": 5.1226907, "_id": "da205ee81a5f62de5cbbb190316880a7"}, {"title": "Three Palestinians killed by Israeli gunfire in West Bank", "author": "TODAY", "published_date": "2023-12-16 21:59:33", "published_date_precision": "full", "link": "https://www.todayonline.com/world/three-palestinians-killed-israeli-gunfire-west-bank-palestinian-health-ministry-2327361", "clean_url": "todayonline.com", "excerpt": "Three Palestinians, including a teenager, were killed by Israeli gunfire in separate incidents in the occupied West Bank on Saturday, according to the Palestinian health ministry.

Social media is also often abuzz with advertisements showcasing crossbred pedigrees such as 'cavapoos' and 'pomskys'.\n \nAt the SPCA, we frequently encounter prospective adopters inquiring about available pedigree breeds, or smaller-sized dogs. They believe that smaller dogs are easier to manage in a young family, encounter fewer health issues, and possess greater sociability or adaptability.\n \nHowever, the reality is far more intricate. While breed and size may influence some aspects, they merely scratch the surface of a \ndog's multifaceted personality\n.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n File photo of pomsky dogs. (Photo: iStock/Victor Ataide) \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nDespite extensive research on canine personalities and their genetic predispositions, most studies regarding breed-specific traits remain inconclusive.\n \nA survey involving 18,000 dogs highlighted that modern breeds mainly share physical traits, not behavioural ones. It found that breed is not a good predictor of behaviour, explaining only 9 per cent of behavioural variations in individual dogs.\n \nWhen it comes to size, while larger dogs may possess bigger neocortices, possibly making them more trainable and less anxious, there is no one-size-fits-all rule. This isn't to label smaller dogs as inherently more reactive, but their diminutive size might necessitate additional training efforts to bolster confidence.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n File photo. Pet shops featuring miniaturised breeds like teacup poodles are gaining popularity, despite health risks associated with those breeds.(Photo: Mediacorp) \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIrrespective of a dog's size or breed, other factors play a more significant role in decoding their unique personalities.\n \nA dog's genetic background helps shape some of its personality traits. For instance, a puppy born to shy parents is more likely to display fearful tendencies. Additionally, the time a dog spends with its litter mates greatly influences its social skills. Puppies that socialise well in their early days tend to grow into friendly and confident adult dogs.\n \nHowever, the most significant influencer in a dog's personality is you. Like humans, dogs' personalities aren't set in stone; they evolve over time, shaped by their lifestyles and experiences as they age. A 2019 study conducted in Sweden even suggests that dogs' stress levels reflect their owners' and are also affected by their owners' personality traits.\n \nMost canine behaviour can be altered through positive reinforcement and enrichment, especially if training begins early. Training isn't just for your dog - it is a journey that \ninvolves the whole family\n. Creating a nurturing environment filled with enriching experiences is crucial for ensuring your dog's social adjustment.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe appeal of owning a teacup poodle might seem charming, but it's crucial to understand the health hazards these miniature dogs encounter. Frequently bred from the smallest in the litter, they are highly susceptible to various health issues including low blood sugar, respiratory difficulties, heart ailments, arthritis and deformities in the liver or brain.\n \nSimilarly, crossbred pedigrees often suffer from congenital issues like hip dysplasia, epilepsy and kidney diseases, due to subpar breeding practices that prioritise looks over well-being.\n \nInstead of selecting a dog based on breed or personality, it is wiser to assess your lifestyle first. A pet is a lifelong commitment, so you must consider how your circumstances will impact the life you bring home.\n \nIf you already have a bustling household, think about the energy levels your pet should match. While the idea of a playful puppy is attractive, it is akin to adding another toddler to your family. An older dog might bring a touch of calmness along with love and companionship.\n \nConsider future family expansions and initiate behaviour training early to ensure your pet's comfort as your family grows. Heartbreaking decisions often arise when families expand, leaving little room for pets.\n \nFinancial and medical issues\n are top reasons for pet surrenders at the SPCA. While predicting the future is impossible, consider your financial stability and the potential medical needs of your pet. Consider your own health too; if you are prone to respiratory issues, opt for a pet better suited to your needs.\n \nAbove all, reflect on how much time you can dedicate to your pet. If your days are packed with long hours at work, maybe holding off on a pet for now could be the wiser choice.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen you adopt a pet, you gain a level of predictability and insight into the pet's background and life experiences. Unlike purchasing from breeders, where the pet's history might be unclear, adopted animals often come with some information about their temperament, behaviour and health.\n \nBy choosing adoption, you stand against unethical breeding practices. Adoption also provides a second chance for animals that have faced abandonment or neglect, offering them a loving home and a better life.\n \nShelters are filled with an array of pets, making it more likely to find a companion that suits your lifestyle and preferences. After all, bringing a pet into your life isn't just about the joy they bring but also the hope you offer them.\n \n is Executive Director of SPCA Singapore.", "rights": "channelnewsasia.com", "rank": 1591, "topic": "news", "country": "SG", "language": "en", "authors": "Aarthi Sankar", "media": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--xzlHTbTr--/c_crop,h_770,w_1370,x_0,y_138/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2023/12/15/istock-1426224370.jpg?itok=ebeI_QoL", "is_opinion": false, "twitter_account": "@ChannelNewsAsia", "_score": 5.0130053, "_id": "13f2e986d393c5ecc09f037cdb2ce391"}, {"title": "India's government hospitals dust off Covid-care facilities", "author": "Subhendu Maiti \u2192", "published_date": "2023-12-22 06:17:11", "published_date_precision": "full", "link": "https://asianews.network/indias-government-hospitals-dust-off-covid-care-facilities/", "clean_url": "asianews.network", "excerpt": "The health ministry has alerted all states and Union territories in the country to get prepared with infrastructure facilities for Covid-19 care following reports of JN-1 cases, a sub-variant of the\u2026", "summary": "December 22, 2023\n \nKOLKATA\n \u2013 With the Union health ministry's nationwide alert on an uptick in Covid-19 cases, West Bengal health department directed government medical colleges and a large number of secondary-level hospitals in districts to make critical care units (CCUs) functional with adequate infrastructure facilities and human resource strengths.\n\n\nAccording to a senior official at the public health wing of Swasthya Bhaban, with the onset of winter since the end of October there has been a steady rise in influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infection (ARI) in the city and districts.

With every purchase, this innovative platform offers a transformative element: a micro 15-minute confidential session to foster open, non-judgmental conversation where men are heard and supported, not fixed.\nAlpha Harmony, conceived by Gary Steve, pioneers a refreshing approach to personal well-being and self-care. Distinctively, the platform steers clear of terms like 'mental health,' 'therapy,' or 'counseling,' which often carry connotations of fixing or treating. Instead, the company's ethos is rooted in the power of listening and understanding \u2013 a philosophy embodied by Gary Steve's role as a Certified Listener rather than a life coach. \nAlpha Harmony\n strategically avoids conventional mental health labels, emphasizing empathetic listening and understanding.\nThis innovative model is grounded in the belief that everyone, particularly those who lead busy lives, deserves a space to be heard and understood without the implications of needing to be 'fixed.' Alpha Harmony focuses on providing a supportive ear and a moment of respite rather than offering advice or solutions. This approach recognizes that sometimes, the most potent form of support is simply having someone listen attentively and empathetically.\nBy offering micro-sessions of empathetic engagement, Alpha Harmony creates an environment where individuals can share their thoughts and experiences in a setting free from judgment and the traditional labels of mental health care. The compact nature of micro-sessions makes them highly suitable for busy schedules.\nContextualizing Against Traditional Therapy Challenges:\n- High Demand and Limited Availability: The demand for traditional therapy has recently surged, often leading to overbooked therapists and long waiting periods. Alpha Harmony's micro-sessions offer a timely and readily available alternative, ensuring that individuals can access support when needed.\n- Cost Concerns: Traditional therapy can be a significant financial commitment, placing it out of reach for many. Micro-sessions, in contrast, are designed to be more affordable, opening up avenues for support that are financially accessible to a broader audience.\n- Intimidation Factor: Lengthy therapy sessions can be daunting, particularly for those who are exploring support options for the first time. The concise format of Alpha Harmony's sessions reduces this intimidation, offering a more approachable and less formal mode of engagement.\nAdvantages of Alpha Harmony's Micro-Sessions:\n- Convenient and Accessible: The short duration of micro-sessions aligns seamlessly with the hectic pace of modern life, making it easier for busy individuals to find time for personal support.\n- Direct and Impactful Communication: The focused nature of micro-sessions encourages straight-to-the-point conversations, leading to more immediate and meaningful interactions.\n- Regular and Consistent Support: The ability to schedule sessions more frequently fosters a continuous and supportive dialogue, helping build trust and a sense of ongoing connection.\n- Budget-Friendly: These sessions make support more accessible to those whom the expense of conventional counseling might otherwise deter, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional therapy\nAt Alpha Harmony, founded by \nGary Steve\n, they are consciously moving away from the conventional and often stigmatized rhetoric associated with mental health, such as \"you need to go to therapy\" or \"you need help with your mental health.\" Their approach is centered on changing this narrative to a more welcoming and less intimidating one: \"You need to be heard.\"\nShifting the Conversation:\n- Breaking Down Stigma: By avoiding traditional mental health jargon that can sometimes feel like a label or a judgment, the company makes the platform more approachable, especially for men who may be hesitant to seek traditional help due to societal perceptions or personal apprehensions.\n- Emphasizing Empathy and Understanding: \"You need to be heard\" is deeply rooted in empathy and understanding. It implies a space where individuals are not seen as problems to be fixed but as people whose experiences and feelings are valid and worthy of attention.\n- Encouraging Openness: This shift in language from 'therapy' to 'being heard' aims to encourage more open and honest communication. It's about creating a space where men feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and experiences without fear of being judged or needing to fit into a specific diagnostic category.\n- Normalizing Support Seeking: By framing support as an opportunity to be heard, they are working towards normalizing seeking help. It shows that needing to talk and be listened to is a normal, healthy part of life, not something that should only be desired in times of crisis or severe distress.\n- Fostering Connection and Community: Alpha Harmony's approach is designed to provide individual support and build a sense of community. It's about shifting from the solitary journey of traditional therapy to a more inclusive experience where men can connect with others, share their stories, and find common ground.\nInterested

\n \n \nSINGAPORE: As part of a multi-agency effort to clamp down on vaping,  authorities will step up checks at air, land and sea checkpoints in the coming months, starting with Changi Airport.\n \n\"Incoming passengers may be screened for e-vaporisers and their components at the arrival halls, and those found with e-vaporisers or their components will be fined,\" said the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) in a media release on Tuesday (Dec 19).\n \nPassengers carrying e-vaporisers must pass through the Red Channel, which is for people with goods to declare, so that they can dispose of the prohibited items.\u00a0\n \n\"Travellers who declare and surrender these items at the Red Channel will avoid penalties,\" said MOH and HSA.\n \nThey added that the\n\u00a0Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) will continue to conduct security checks to detect and deter smuggling attempts.\n \nVaping is illegal in  and offenders can be fined up to S$2,000 (US$1,490).\u00a0Those who import, distribute or sell such products face stiffer penalties, including a possible jail term.\n \nBut the number of people caught using and possessing vapes has been on the rise, with some school children picking up the habit.\n \nSome users get their supply online from\u00a0messaging applications such as Telegram, or when they go overseas.\n \n\"We are therefore taking measures to protect our population and prevent vapes from taking hold in our society,\" said MOH and HSA.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nApart from the border checkpoints, checks will be stepped up at places such as\u00a0the central business district, shopping centres, parks, smoking areas, as well as public entertainment outlets such as bars and clubs.\n \nAuthorities described these as\u00a0\"public hotspots\", adding that offenders will be issued with a fine on the spot.\n \nMOH and HSA noted that since Dec 1, enforcement officers from the\u00a0National Environment Agency have been empowered to take action against people who use or own vapes.\u00a0\n \nThey added that they are also\u00a0working with the Ministry of Communications and Information and Infocomm Media Development Authority to improve the detection and removal of sales and advertisements of vapes online.\n \nHSA said it already monitors the illicit sale of e-vaporisers via social media and messaging platforms to curb online access of such items.\n \nSchools and institutes of higher learning will strengthen detection and enforcement efforts against vaping.\n \n\"When students are caught using or in possession of e-vaporisers, the prohibited product will be confiscated and their parents will be informed,\" said the authorities.\n \nOffenders will be reported to HSA, while their vaping-related offences will be managed through the schools' \"existing disciplinary frameworks\" which may include suspension or caning for boys.\n \n\"Students caught vaping will also be placed on cessation support programmes where counsellors will guide them through their cessation journey to effect long-term behavioural change,\" said MOH and HSA.\n \nThey added that the Health Promotion Board will continue to work with the Education Ministry\u00a0to amplify anti-vaping messages, raise awareness of the harms of vaping and provide support to stop vaping for students.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nVapes typically contain nicotine, which is highly addictive, as well as other cancer-causing chemicals and toxic substances that increase the risk of heart and lung diseases.\n \n\"The toxic substances found in the heated aerosol produced by e-vaporisers can harm users and others through second-hand exposure,\" MOH and HSA warned.\n \n\"In addition, there is evidence that e-vaporisers can be a gateway for non-smokers, particularly youths, to start using cigarettes.\"\n \n authorities said that their multi-agency approach is aimed at protecting its population from\u00a0such harmful tobacco products and preventing vaping from being entrenched locally.\n \nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said last week that \nurgent action is needed to\u00a0control e-cigarettes\n to protect children and non-smokers.\n \nIt added that more 13- to 15-year-olds are using vapes than adults in all WHO regions, helped by aggressive marketing.\n \nThe WHO called on governments to implement changes, including bans on all flavouring agents like menthol, and the application of tobacco control measures to vapes.",

Here's a list of best investments for mothers that are better than bags, cars, and jewelries.\nInvesting in things like property, insurance, government savings, and mutual funds is like building a solid foundation for you and your family's future. Unlike splurging on bags, jewelry, and cars (which, let's be real, are tempting!), these investments bring long-term security and growth. So, let's ditch the temporary thrills and focus on making strategic choices that set you up for lasting financial well-being and value. Here's a list of best investments for mothers that are better than material possessions.\n\n\nBest investments for mothers: Property investments\n\n\nMotherhood is a journey of nurturing, but it's also an opportunity for financial empowerment. For mothers seeking stable and long-term financial growth, property investments stand out as one of the best options. Here's why:\n \nProperties, especially real estate, have a historical track record of stability and appreciation. Unlike some financial instruments, real estate values tend to increase over time, providing a reliable and potentially profitable investment.\n \nOwning rental properties can offer a steady stream of passive income. Mothers can leverage their \ninvestment\n by renting out properties, generating monthly rental income to support family needs or contribute to savings and investments.\n\n\n\n\nImage from Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\n3. Asset Diversification\n\n\nDiversifying one's investment portfolio is a fundamental principle of sound financial planning. Properties add a layer of diversification, reducing risk by not solely relying on the performance of stocks or bonds.\n\n\n4. Tangible and Inflation Hedge\n\n\nReal estate is a tangible asset with intrinsic value. It serves as a hedge against inflation, as property values and rental income have the potential to increase in line with or even outpace inflation rates.\n\n\n5. Long-Term Wealth Creation\n\n\nProperty investments are a vehicle for long-term wealth creation. As mothers plan for their children's education, weddings, or future endeavors, property appreciation and rental income can contribute significantly to achieving these financial goals.\n\n\n6. Security and Stability for Families\n\n\nMothers prioritize the well-being and security of their families. Owning a property provides a sense of stability, as families have a place to call home, and property values typically appreciate, contributing to overall financial security.\n\n\n7. Tax Advantages\n\n\nProperty owners often benefit from various tax advantages. Deductions for mortgage interest, property taxes, and other related expenses can result in significant tax savings, enhancing the overall financial picture.\n\n\n8. Legacy and Inheritance\n\n\nProperty investments enable mothers to create a lasting legacy for their children. Real estate can be passed down through generations, providing financial stability and security for the family's future.\n\n\n9. Control and Personalization\n\n\nProperty ownership allows mothers to have control over their investments. From choosing the location to deciding on property improvements, mothers can personalize their investments to align with their financial goals and preferences.\n\n\n10. Potential for Real-Time Use\n\n\nProperties can serve dual purposes. While appreciating in value, certain properties can also be used for personal or family needs, offering both an investment and a living space.\n\n\nIn conclusion, property investments stand out as an excellent choice for mothers looking to secure their family's financial future. Beyond financial gains, the stability, passive income, and long-term wealth creation potential make property investments a wise and empowering financial move for mothers who strive to provide the best for their families.\n\n\nBest investments for mothers\u00a0\n\n\nAside from property investments, here's a list of investments that are best for moms and that will benefit their family.\n\n\n\n\nPhilippine Stock Market\n: Investing in stocks listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) can provide opportunities for capital appreciation.\n\n\nMutual Funds:\n Participating in mutual funds managed by local fund managers allows for diversified investments in stocks, bonds, and other securities.\n\n\n\n\nImage from \nShutterstock\n\n\n\n\nRetail Treasury Bonds (RTBs)\n: Government-issued bonds like RTBs provide a secure investment option with regular interest payments.\n\n\nPag-IBIG MP2 Savings Program\n: The Pag-IBIG MP2 is a voluntary savings program that offers higher dividend rates than regular savings accounts.\n\n\nPhilippine Depositary Receipts (PDRs)\n: PDRs allow investment in Philippine companies without directly owning the shares.\n\n\nBusiness Franchising\n: Starting a franchise business can be a lucrative venture with established brand support.\n\n\nPhilippine Government Savings Bonds (GSB)\n: GSBs offer a low-risk option for conservative investors with regular interest payments.\n\n\nCooperative Shares: I\nnvesting in a cooperative provides an opportunity for profit-sharing and community involvement.\n\n\nBalikbayan Box Forwarding Business\n: Facilitating the shipment of balikbayan boxes for Filipinos abroad can be a viable business idea.\n\n\nCryptocurrencies:\n While relatively new, Filipinos can explore investing in cryptocurrencies as an alternative asset class.\n\n\nSari-Sari Store or Mini-Grocery Business\n: Starting a small retail business can cater to local communities and generate steady income.\n\n\nPhilippine Retail Treasury Bills (RTBs)\n: RTBs are short-term government securities offering a secure investment option.\n\n\nFarm Investment\n: Participating in agricultural ventures or agribusiness investments can support the local economy.\n\n\nPhilippine Educational Plans (Pre-Need Plans)\n: Investing in pre-need educational plans helps secure future educational expenses for children.\n\n\n\n\nBefore making any investment, it's important to conduct thorough research, consider individual financial goals, and assess risk tolerance. Consulting with a local financial advisor familiar with the Philippine market can provide valuable insights and guidance.\n\n\nWhy are these better than bags, cars and jewelries\n\n\nInvesting in financial instruments such as stocks, real estate, bonds, and other options mentioned earlier is often considered a more strategic and prudent approach compared to spending on luxury items like bags, cars, and jewelry for several reasons:\n\n\n\n\nWealth Building:\n Financial investments have the potential to grow over time, building wealth and creating financial security. Luxury items, on the other hand, are typically depreciating assets that lose value over time.\n\n\nIncome Generation\n: Many financial instruments, such as stocks, bonds, and rental properties, have the potential to generate regular income through dividends, interest payments, or rental yields. In contrast, bags, cars, and jewelry do not generate income and may only represent a one-time purchase.\n\n\nDiversification:\n Investing allows for diversification across different asset classes, reducing risk. Luxury items represent a concentrated form of spending and do not provide the same level of risk mitigation.\n\n\nLong-Term Value:\n Financial investments are often geared toward long-term value appreciation. Over time, the value of well-selected investments may increase, providing a solid return on investment. Luxury items, however, tend to lose value or depreciate as trends change.\n\n\nEmergency Fund and Future Planning\n: Investments can serve as a source of funds for emergencies or future financial goals such as education, retirement, or a home purchase. Luxury items, while enjoyable, do not offer the same practical financial benefits.\n\n\nInflation Hedge:\u00a0\n Some investments, such as real estate and certain commodities, can act as a hedge against inflation, preserving purchasing power. Luxury items are typically not inflation-resistant and may lose value in real terms over the years.\n\n\nLiquidity:\n Financial investments are generally more liquid than physical assets like bags, cars, or jewelry. It is easier to sell or convert investments into cash when needed, providing greater flexibility in managing financial needs.\n\n\n\u00a0Passive Income\n: Certain investments, like dividend-paying stocks or rental properties, offer opportunities for passive income, allowing individuals to earn money without actively working for it. Luxury items do not provide a source of passive income.\n\n\n\u00a0\nFuture Needs:\n Investing in education plans, retirement accounts, or property can contribute to securing future needs and financial well-being. Luxury items, while enjoyable, may not contribute to long-term financial security.\n\n\nReduced Depreciation:\n While all assets carry some level of risk, financial investments are generally subject to less depreciation compared to luxury items, which may rapidly lose value due to changing trends or wear and tear.\n\n\n\n\nIt's essential to strike a balance between enjoying life's luxuries and making strategic financial decisions. While there's nothing inherently wrong with purchasing bags, cars, or jewelry, considering investments as part of a comprehensive financial plan can contribute to long-term financial stability and growth.\n\n\nAnother best investment for moms: Health insurance\n\n\n\n\nImage from Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\nHealth insurance stands out as a strategic investment, providing financial security and promoting overall well-being. In contrast to spending on luxury items like bags, cars, and jewelry, health insurance offers tangible benefits:\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Protection\n: Health insurance covers medical expenses, shielding individuals and families from the financial strain of healthcare costs, including hospitalization, surgeries, and medications.\n\n\nPreventive Care\n: Many plans include coverage for preventive services, encouraging regular health check-ups and screenings for early detection of health issues.\n\n\nEmergency Coverage\n: Health insurance ensures access to emergency medical care, providing peace of mind during unforeseen health crises.\n\n\nAccess to Quality Healthcare:\n It grants access to a network of healthcare providers, guaranteeing quality medical care without prohibitive expenses.\n\n\nWellness Programs:\n Some plans offer wellness programs, promoting a healthy lifestyle and providing incentives for maintaining good health.\n\n\nLong-Term Health Planning\n: Health insurance is a crucial element in long-term health planning, preparing individuals for potential health challenges in the future.\n\n\n\u00a0Coverage for Family:\n Plans often extend coverage to family members, ensuring comprehensive healthcare for the entire family.\n\n\nTax Benefits\n: In some regions, contributions to health insurance plans may come with tax benefits, providing an additional financial incentive.\n\n\n\n\nWhile bags, cars, and jewelry offer lifestyle enhancements, health insurance is a practical investment in physical well-being and financial security, acting as a safety net against the high costs of medical care.", "rights": "theasianparent.com", "rank": 20547, "topic": "news", "country": "SG", "language": "en", "authors": "Teresa Alcantara", "media": "https://static.cdntap.com/tap-assets-prod/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2023/12/shutterstock_538969471-2.jpg", "is_opinion": false, "twitter_account": null, "_score": 4.8573756, "_id": "546ea9d4b5fa36a9c1bfdec607d517c8"}, {"title": "Vigilance, voluntary mask usage amid emerging health threats: Senator", "author": "Philippine Daily Inquirer", "published_date": "2023-12-21 02:49:28", "published_date_precision": "full", "link": "https://asianews.network/vigilance-voluntary-mask-usage-amid-emerging-health-threats-senator", "clean_url": "asianews.network", "excerpt": "Vigilance, voluntary mask usage amid emerging health threats: Senator Asia News Network (ANN) is the leading regional alliance of news titles striving to bring the region closer, through an active sharing of editorial content on happenings in the region.", "summary": "December 21, 2023\n\nManila, Philippines \u2014 Senator Christopher 'Bong' Go, chairperson of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography, emphasized the crucial lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic and the necessity for bolstered preparedness in the Philippine healthcare system amid rising cases of influenza, flu and other respiratory diseases.\n\n'The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for us to always prioritize improving the resilience of our communities and the health systems on which they depend,' Go began his opening statement, underlining the pandemic's profound impact during a Senate hearing on Monday.\n\n'Marami po tayong natutunan sa nakaraang pandemya. At marami po tayong isinusulong para mas mapalakas ang ating healthcare system. Dapat mas handa po tayo ngayon sa anumang health emergency na maaaring dumating,' he added.\n\n(We've learned so much during the pandemic. We also organized and launched programs to strengthen our healthcare system. If there's any health emergency, we should be more prepared right now)\n\nReferencing his role in the 2019 budget deliberations as vice chairperson of the Senate Committee on Finance, Go shared a prescient decision concerning the funding for the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).\n\n''Yung pinropose po nila na mababawasan na opisina ng budget sa Department of Health (DOH) ay \u2018yung RITM\u2026 Kutob ko lang po noong panahong iyon na huwag bawasan ang RITM, dinagdagan pa natin, ni-restore pa natin at dinagdagan pa natin ang pondo ng RITM for 2020,' he said.\n\n(They proposed to cut the budget of Department of Health's RITM but I felt the need not to do it. So we even added budget and restored RITM's budget for 2020)\n\nThis foresight was proven accurate when, in January 2020, news emerged from China about COVID-19, leading to a state of health emergency declared on March 7, 2020. The RITM, being vital in conducting COVID-19 tests.\n\nThe senator then addressed the recent rise in respiratory illnesses both in the Philippines and internationally.\n\n'Mayroon din po akong nababalitaan sa ibang bansa tumataas ang kaso, last month. The Chinese National Health Commission reported an increase in incidence of respiratory diseases in China. Rise in respiratory illness was also reported in Europe and North America,' he stated.\n\nREAD: Bong Go renews push for CDC and Medical Reserve Corps establishment\n\nThis global trend, according to Go, is mirrored in the Philippines, with the DOH reporting a higher number of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) this year compared to last. Go then highlighted the current state of COVID-19 in the country and the corresponding health care responses.\n\nAs to COVID-19 cases, the DOH recorded 260 daily average COVID cases from December 5 to 11, slightly higher than the 191 case average the week before. The Philippine General Hospital (PGH) also began implementing the mandatory use of face masks inside the hospital.\n\nAssistant Secretary Maylene Beltran of the Public Health Services Team A of the DOH cited the uptick in respiratory ILI cases, comparable to global trends. She attributed the recorded uptick to enhanced monitoring of ILI cases and improved surveillance systems, a lesson from the COVID-19 experience.\n\nWith the lifting of mask restrictions and increased population mobility, especially during the Christmas season, Beltran echoed Senator Go's appeal for the need for continued mask usage, despite its voluntary nature.\n\nGo, delving deeper into public health concerns, inquired about walking pneumonia cases in the country and the differentiation between symptoms of ordinary pneumonia, walking pneumonia, and COVID-19.\n\n'Baka po pwede n'yo ma-explain, ma-encourage n'yo po ang ating mga kababayan na magpa-check up po kung kailangan dahil ilang araw na itong karamdaman nila. Na maaaring makahawa at maging delikado po ang kanilang buhay dahil hindi pa sila nakapag-check up at hindi po natitreat itong karamdaman nila,' he added.\n\n(Maybe you can explain, encourage our fellow countrymen to get checked because their condition has been like this for many days now. Also to let them know that they could infect others and that this would be hazardous to themselves if they don't undergo necessary tests and don't receive proper treatment to their condition)\n\nResponding to Go's queries, Dr. Alethea de Guzman, Director IV of the Epidemiology Bureau of the DOH, elaborated on the surveillance system, now shifting towards pan-respiratory surveillance due to the similar presentation of diseases like influenza, pneumonia, and COVID-19. She explained that these illnesses typically begin with fever, coughing, and sore throat, making initial differentiation challenging.\n\nDe Guzman also emphasized the importance of testing for accurate diagnosis and noted that the elderly and those with comorbidities are more prone to severe disease. Addressing the concerns about 'walking pneumonia,' she clarified that it often presents mild symptoms and is distinguishable through testing.\n\nDr. Razel Nikka Hao, Director IV of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the DOH, also addressed the issue of 'walking pneumonia,' a term causing confusion among the public. She explained that this terminology arises from people unknowingly carrying the disease while continuing their daily activities.\n\nREAD: DOH reports four cases of \u2018walking pneumonia'\n\nHao clarified that the term does not indicate a higher transmissibility but rather highlights the mild nature of symptoms. She underscored the role of masks in preventing the transmission of various respiratory illnesses, stating, ''Yung mask nakaka-prevent pa rin.'\n\nMeanwhile, DOH Secretary Teodoro Herbosa, during the hearing, has declared the department's preparedness not only against COVID-19 but against a spectrum of health concerns.\n\nGo stressed the importance of preparedness and proactive measures against respiratory diseases like COVID-19 and influenza, citing a case of fatal pneumonia in a 78-year-old who had recently returned from abroad.\n\n'Mas mabuti na maging proactive tayo sa ating mga approaches sa laban dito,' Go emphasized.\n\n(It's better to be proactive in terms of our approaches in this issue)\n\nHerbosa, in his response, indicated their commitment on the DOH's focus of protecting the health of every Filipino.\n\n'Madami tayong natutunan noong panahon ng pagbugso ng COVID, noong unang beses itong dumating\u2026 there are other diseases we also monitor and survey during the time of the holidays,' the health secretary said.\n\nThis includes a rise in non-communicable diseases such as heart attacks, strokes, and diabetes, as well as road accidents due to increased partying.\n\n'Sabay po \u2018yan, \u2018yung infectious disease, nakatutok po tayo d'yan through surveillance and monitoring,' Herbosa added.\n\nAmidst these challenges, Go, in his concluding remarks, reiterated the need for continued discipline and vigilance in the face of health challenges.\n\n'Alam niyo, kung hindi naman po sagabal sa ating mga kababayan, ako ini-encourage ko pa rin kayong magsuot ng face mask, dahil hindi natin alam sino po ang may dalang sakit, sino po ang maaaring mahawa sa ating pamamahay kung hindi naman po sagabal,' he urged.\n\n'Mahigit dalawang taon naman tayong naging disiplinado sa pagsuot nito.

A paediatrician clinic and family therapist share tips on keeping your family happy and well.", "summary": "Are you're looking to keep your kids sickness-free at a paediatrician clinic, or promote good mental health in your crew with a family therapist? Here are some great family health clinic tips for promoting family wellness in 2024.\n\n\n#1 Make routine health checks a priority\n\n\nPart of being healthier as a family includes preventative care in little ones. 'In the first three years of a child's life it's essential to set a good foundation for their development and health,' says DR MOHANA RAJAKULENDRAN of Petite Practice, a paediatrician clinic which provides specialist medical care for babies and children.\n\n\nIt's key to have routine check-ins with your paediatrician clinic or GP during these years to assess developmental milestones and growth, she advises. 'From birth, these are initially two-monthly check-ups, which gradually space out to six-monthly appointments by the time the child is two.'\n\n\nDr Mohana\n\n\n#2 Book in those vaccinations with your paediatrician clinic\n\n\nThese check-ups can be paired with routine vaccinations. 'It's important to keep on top of recommended vaccine schedules for your local and home countries for early protection against preventable diseases,' explains Dr Rajakulendran. If you're planning travel, discuss these plans a month ahead with your paediatrician or GP. This is especially important if you're heading off the beaten track on rural or adventure travel with kids. Travel vaccinations can give additional protection before you go. 'In Asia, protection against hepatitis A might be important, and additional malaria prevention is recommended for certain areas,' says Dr Rajakulendran. 'Up-to-date influenza vaccinations before winter travel are also a good idea given the peak in respiratory infections seen.'\n\n\n#3 Keep on top of kids' allergies\n\n\nAnother aspect of early preventative care is protection against the development of childhood allergies. According to Dr Rajakulendran 'eczema, food allergies, asthma and allergic rhinitis are on the rise globally.' Early protection with gentle soap-free cleansers and fragrance-free moisturising can help reduce the risk of early onset eczema in high-risk families, she says. 'It's best to obtain safe weaning advice from your paediatrician so you're well-equipped to introduce allergens early on, between six to twelve months of age.'\n\n\n\n\n#4 Establish good gut health for little ones\n\n\n'Maintaining healthy gut balance by the introduction of healthy probiotic-rich foods and supplements early in life can be helpful in reducing the risk of developing allergies,' says Dr Rajakulendran. Increasing outdoor play and exposure to natural environments also helps reduce the risk of allergy development from early in life. 'And protecting babies from viral infections early on in life also helps reduce the risk of asthma.'\n\n\nPetite Practice\n is at 467C Joo Chiat Road. \n6233 2191\n | \npetitepractice.com\n\n\n#5 Give your teen the gift of good mental health with a family therapist\n\n\nGeneration Z (teens and early twenty-somethings) are the hardest hit when it comes to mental health. They're more likely to face different forms of stress, anxiety and depression, according to LILIAN LOO, family therapist at Promises Healthcare, which provides mental health treatment to adults, adolescents and children.\n\n\nHome is often where symptoms of constant sadness, withdrawal, sleep deprivation, anxiety or school pressure surface. 'It's useful to have open communication with your teens rather than to dismiss their concerns in a bid to reassure. Normalise conversations about mental health, or they may turn to social media and peers, and risk becoming misinformed,' says Lilian.\n\n\nLILIAN LOO\n\n\nA routine of sleeping early and having a good night's rest is essential to overall mood and functioning. 'Exercise releases \u2018feel good' endorphin and serotonin chemicals, and improves fitness, which helps elevate mood,' she adds. 'And being active outdoors can also distract from negative thought patterns.'\n\n\nSome parents worry about the stigma of seeking professional advice, and this may act as a barrier to adolescents accessing the help they need. Lilian recommends that if your teen is showing signs of depression, anxiety and mental health concerns, support them to obtain help from a family therapist early to prevent deterioration.\n\n\n#6 Take the time to reconnect with your partner\n\n\nIt's common in Singapore for the breadwinner to work long hours and travel frequently on business trips. While it's useful to build your own support network, it's still important to continue nurturing closeness with your spouse. Lilian suggests doing something spontaneous and relaxing like sneaking out for last-minute supper, or catching a late-night movie when the children are asleep and the helper's at home.\n\n\nKeep talking! 'If you find that both of you have difficulty understanding each other's needs, have an open and honest conversation. Hear each other out, without judging or blaming,' says Lilian. 'If you feel that your marriage is missing the spark or intimacy or you're becoming like strangers with conversation revolving only around children, it's time to do a marital health check and work on the marriage at couples therapy.'\n\n\n\n\n#7 Take care of yourself too!\n\n\nExpat women often experience loneliness due to the sense of isolation and separation from family and friends. Moving to a new country and adjusting to unfamiliar cultures with inadequate support can feel overwhelming. Difficulty obtaining a permit to work can also mean a loss of career.\n\n\nLilian highlights the importance of taking time for yourself. You may secretly long for a break which never quite happened earlier due to the demands of work and family. 'This may be your season to go slow. Whether it's an interest in Zumba or K-pop dancing, here's your window of opportunity to pursue your interests. It's too good to miss and regret,' she says.\n\n\n'Reach out and make friends. It offers a sense of comfort when you find likeminded others who may be waiting to connect with you.' Expat women can be found in pre-natal groups, parents' support groups, mothers' playgroups, international schools, Facebook and online. Don't be afraid to ask for professional help. 'It can be stressful going through change when you move cities or become homesick. You may be dealing with job loss or transitioning to a fulltime mum and your identity is taking a dip,' says Lilian. Talking to a therapist will help you find renewed purpose.\n\n\nPromises Healthcare\n\n#09-23, #09-18 & #11-16 Novena Medical Center, 10 Sinaran Drive.\n\n\n6397 7309\n | \nclinic@promises.com.sg\n\n\npromises.com.sg", "rights": "expatliving.sg", "rank": 145951, "topic": "news", "country": "SG", "language": "en", "authors": "Amy Greenburg", "media": "https://expatliving.sg/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kids-health.jpg", "is_opinion": false, "twitter_account": "@expatlivingSG", "_score": 4.7063007, "_id": "c8772640635871dc18a3c3fad537349b"}, {"title": "US-based rights group accuses Israel of 'starvation' tactic in Gaza", "author": "CNA", "published_date": "2023-12-18 13:05:43", "published_date_precision": "full", "link": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/us-rights-group-israel-starvation-tactic-gaza-3996941", "clean_url": "channelnewsasia.com", "excerpt": "CAIRO: US-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) accused Israel on Monday (Dec 18) of trying to starve Palestinians in Gaza during its war with Hamas, a charge Israel said came from an \"antisemitic\" group\u2026", "summary": "CAIRO: US-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) accused Israel on Monday (Dec 18) of trying to starve Palestinians in Gaza during its war with Hamas, a charge Israel said came from an \"antisemitic\" group that did not warrant an answer.\n \nWith no let-up in the bombardment and siege of the densely-populated enclave, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was the latest US official to head to Israel to press its ally to transition away from high-intensity warfare.\n \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to carry on until \"absolute victory\" despite foreign pressure to ease up in Gaza, where buildings lie in ruins, hunger is rife, and health authorities say around 19,000 Palestinians have been killed.\n \nDespite a rising global outcry over the toll among Gaza's civilians, who have nowhere to go, Israel is bent on eliminating Hamas militants behind an Oct 7 rampage that killed 1,200 people and took 240 hostages, according to Israeli authorities.\n \nIn its report, HRW said Israeli forces were deliberately blocking delivery of water, food and fuel, razing agricultural areas and depriving the coastal enclave's 2.3 million people - most of whom have left homeless - of items needed for survival.\n \n\"The Israeli government is using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare in the occupied Gaza Strip,\" HRW, a global group based in New York, said in a report.\n \n\" leaders should be speaking out against this abhorrent war crime.\"\n \nIsrael responded by calling HRW an \"antisemitic and anti-Israeli\" group with no moral right to criticise after its \"silent\" reaction to the Oct 7 killings.\n \n\"All their agenda is anti-Israel and they deserve no response,\" said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lior Haiat.\n \nIsrael has frequently denied targeting civilians while saying Hamas is to blame for civilian deaths by embedding itself in residential areas.

In 2021, the disease \nclaimed the lives of 6.7 million individuals globally\n. In Singapore, \nmore than 400,000 people are living with the condition\n \nwhile another 430,000 residents aged between 18 and 69 are classed as pre-diabetic\n.\u00a0\n \n'Diabetes is projected to affect \nnearly one million Singaporeans by 2050\n if left untreated,' noted Dr Kevin Tan, consultant endocrinologist at the Kevin Tan Clinic for Diabetes, Thyroid and Hormones. 'By the same year, the \nfinancial burden of diabetes could climb to an estimated S$2.5 billion annually, up from S$1 billion in 2010\n.'\n \nA SILENT DISEASE WITH SERIOUS HEALTH IMPLICATIONS\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n According to Dr Tan, diabetes is projected to affect nearly one million Singaporeans by 2050 without intervention. \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nDiabetes is a chronic and progressive condition in which the body fails to produce sufficient insulin or cannot utilise insulin effectively. Insulin, a hormone synthesised by the pancreas, plays a pivotal role in regulating blood glucose levels. In instances of insulin resistance or insufficient insulin production, excess glucose accumulates in the bloodstream and can lead to outcomes such as \ndamage to the eyes, nerves, kidneys and blood vessels\n.\u00a0\n \nType 2 diabetes, the \nmost common form of diabetes locally\n, is associated with several risk factors, including obesity. According to Dr Tan, obesity is believed to account for \n80 to 85 per cent of the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes\n. Other risk factors for the condition include age, a family history of the disease, physical inactivity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking and gestational diabetes.\u00a0\n \n'Diabetes can result in a host of serious health complications, such as heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure and non-healing foot ulcers that can potentially become infected, leading to amputation of the affected limb,' said Dr Tan.\n \nELEVATED CARDIOVASCULAR AND KIDNEY-RELATED RISKS\n \nGiven the \nintricate interconnection of the cardiovascular, renal and metabolic systems\n, the complications triggered by diabetes in one system can swiftly impact others and culminate in a condition known as \ncardio renal metabolic (CRM) syndrome\n.\n \nExplained Dr Low Lip Ping, a cardiologist at Low Cardiology Clinic and chairman emeritus of the Singapore Heart Foundation: 'Over time, uncontrolled high blood sugar can damage blood vessels and the kidneys, resulting in elevated blood pressure levels.'\u00a0\n \nDr Jason Choo, senior consultant in the Department of Renal Medicine at Singapore General Hospital, further underscores that heightened blood pressure and diabetes independently or jointly represent the primary causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD) leading to end-stage kidney failure in adults, which account for \napproximately 80 per cent of all kidney failure cases worldwide\n.\u00a0\n \n'CKD is characterised by irreversible and progressive loss of kidney function in filtering waste and fluids from your blood. In its advanced stages, CKD can cause dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes, and waste to build up in the body,' he said. \u00a0\n \nAccording to a \nstudy\n, an estimated 20 to 40 per cent of individuals with diabetes are projected to develop diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Notably, diabetes remains the leading cause of end-stage kidney failure in Singapore, accounting for \n67 per cent of new cases\n.\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n Diabetes remains the leading cause of end-stage kidney failure in Singapore, according to figures from the The National Kidney Foundation. \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nDr Choo elaborated: 'Diabetic kidney disease can advance more rapidly compared to non-DKD cases. Individuals with the former are at a higher risk of encountering CKD-associated complications, including hypervolemia, a condition where fluid overload in the body results in swelling, high blood pressure, heart problems and other issues.'\u00a0\n \nDiabetes contributes to another alarming statistic: In Singapore, \none out of every two individuals who suffers a heart attack is diabetic\n. Moreover, those with diabetes \nface a risk up to four times higher for stroke and are twice as likely to succumb to complications following a myocardial infarction\n \u2013 commonly known as a heart attack \u2013 compared to non-diabetics.\n \n'Because coronary artery disease (CAD) is often asymptomatic in diabetic patients, some individuals could be diagnosed with CAD during comprehensive health screenings that include an electrocardiogram, an inducible myocardial ischaemia with exercise stress test (usually treadmill exercise), or an imaging procedure (echocardiography or nuclear) that can provide risk assessment for adverse health outcomes,' said Dr Low.\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n Coronary artery disease commonly exhibits no symptoms in diabetic patients, says Dr Low. \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nHe emphasised that proper \nscreening and diagnosis of CAD is crucial for the prevention and early treatment of coronary events\n, especially in those with diabetes.\u00a0\n \nSimilarly, early detection and proactive management of DKD is crucial for slowing its progression and delaying associated complications, said Dr Choo. Without intervention, individuals may advance to end-stage kidney failure, necessitating dialysis treatment, with haemodialysis being the most commonly employed approach. Significantly, \nSingapore has the highest per capita incidence globally for diabetes-induced kidney failure\n.\u00a0\n \n'Haemodialysis is not only painful and inconvenient, but expensive as well,' noted Dr Choo. 'CKD places a heavy financial burden on patients and their families, and the process of dialysis can also exert an emotional and physical toll. Patients undergoing dialysis may experience depression and a diminished quality of life.' \u00a0\n \nMANAGING DIABETES THROUGH LIFESTYLE CHANGES AND MODERN MEDICINE\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n Regular screening for blood glucose levels can facilitate timely treatment and management of diabetes, shares Dr Tan. \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nWhile diabetes remains a chronic condition without a cure, individuals in the early stages of diabetes \ncan take steps\n to delay its onset or slow its progression, along with mitigating the risk of associated complications such as CRM syndrome.\n \nThese measures involve maintaining healthy blood glucose levels through a balanced diet rich in vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, coupled with a consistent routine of regular exercise.\n \nWhen these strategies prove insufficient, medication is harnessed for the effective management of diabetes, Dr Tan highlighted.\u00a0\n \n'There are various classes of antidiabetic medication \u2013 ranging from oral to injectables \u2013 that have undergone rigorous examination in clinical trials, to enhance the management of diabetes and its associated complications,' he explained.\u00a0\n \nUltimately, the selection of medication hinges on the patient's specific needs, medical history, and preferences. It is crucial for patients to consult with their healthcare professionals to ascertain the most suitable treatment plan.\n \nAccording to Dr Tan, all adults aged 40 or above should undergo diabetes screening once every three years if their blood sugar results are normal, while individuals with borderline test results should opt for annual screenings.\n \n'Early detection can facilitate timely treatment, enabling you to manage your condition with lifestyle changes and/or medication before complications involving the heart and kidney develop,' he advised.\u00a0\n \nThe Ministry of Health's national screening programme, Screen for Life, offers subsidised screenings for Singapore citizens and permanent residents at Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) general practitioner clinics. Screen for Life is also fully subsidised for individuals enrolled under Healthier SG, at their enrolled clinic.

It also suggested that currently available vaccines and treatments were still effective against JN.1.\n\n\nLatest VOI\n\n\nWhile the majority of JN.1 cases showed mild symptoms, Imran Pambudi, the ministry's infectious disease prevention and control director, said the new strain could cause severe disease in high-risk groups, such as the elderly, people with underlying health conditions and people with weakened immune systems.\n\n\n'We urge the public to implement good personal hygiene to prevent infection, such as frequent handwashing, wearing masks when sick or in crowded places, staying home [when ill] and getting COVID-19 vaccines, especially for at-risk groups,' Imran said.\n\n\nDue to its increasing global spread, JN.1 has been designated as a variant of interest (VOI), one level below variant of concern (VOC) on WHO's classification system, and refers to a variant's relative prevalence compared to others circulating in an area or region and its potential epidemiological changes 'to suggest an emerging risk to global public health'.\n\n\nAccording to the WHO's initial JN.1 risk evaluation published on Dec. 19, the new variant is rated 'low' for overall risk to public health.\n\n\nIt remains unclear if JN.1 is driving the recent uptick in local cases, as the Health Ministry had detected in early December another COVID-19 subvariant classified as a VOI: EG.5, informally called 'Eris'.\n\n\nSince EG.5 was first reported to the WHO in February, it has spread to more than 90 countries and makes up slightly over half of the COVID-19 variants circulating globally, due to its ability to escape immune responses.\n\n\nDespite its higher transmissibility, EG.5 reportedly has a lower fatality rate compared to other subvariants.\n\n\nSafe travel\n\n\nThe detection of JN.1 in the country comes as millions of Indonesians prepare to travel during the year-end holiday season.\n\n\nA recent survey by the Transportation Ministry revealed that 107 million people, or 40 percent of the population, were planning to travel over the Christmas and New Year holidays.\n\n\nHealth authorities urged travelers to remain vigilant against COVID-19 during the holiday season, in view of the significant increase in new cases since November.\n\n\nThe government recorded more than 2,000 new COVID-19 cases in the past week, almost twice the 1,245 cases recorded during the previous week, with at least 16 deaths recorded nationwide since Dec. 1.\n\n\nRead also: Govt to stop paying for COVID-19 treatments, vaccines on Sept. 1\n\n\nThe ministry confirmed on Thursday 453 new cases, the second-highest daily figure since July 12, after the 486 cases recorded on Wednesday.\n\n\nAirline and train operators recently advised all passengers to weak masks and adhere to the COVID-19 health protocols during their trips.\n\n\nThe Health Ministry plans to provide a third round of COVID-19 booster doses for the elderly and people with comorbidities by next year to protect them and the general population against the new strains.

Organization (WHO) said Thursday (Dec 21), describing \"unbearable\" scenes of largely abandoned patients begging for food and water.\n \nThe UN health agency said it had led missions to two badly damaged\u00a0hospitals, Al-Shifa and Al-Ahli, in the north of the Palestinian territory on Wednesday.\n \n\"Our staff are running out of words to describe the beyond catastrophic situation facing remaining patients and health workers,\" said Mr Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO representative for the occupied Palestinian territory.\n \nHis comment came amid increasingly frantic diplomatic efforts to secure a pause in the war that Hamas says has already claimed 20,000 lives in Gaza, 70 per cent of them women and children.\n \nThe war began when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct 7, killing around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n \nWHO has already described Al-Shifa, the largest\u00a0hospital\u00a0in Gaza which last month was the focus of an extended Israeli army operation and has been devastated by Israeli bombardments, as \"a blood bath\".\u00a0\n \nThe smaller Al-Ahli\u00a0hospital\u00a0had since become the only place where surgeries were possible in the north, but its director said it had stopped operating on Tuesday after being stormed by the Israeli army.\n \nDYING 'SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY'\n \nThe WHO-led mission revealed that Al Ahli, which just two days ago was \"overwhelmed with patients needing emergency care\", was now \"a shell of a\u00a0hospital\", Mr Peeperkorn told reporters in Geneva via video link from Jerusalem.\n \n\"There are\u00a0no\u00a0operating theatres anymore due to the lack of fuel, power, medical supplies and health workers, including surgeons and other specialists,\" he added.\n \n\"It has completely stopped functioning.\"\n \nOf Gaza's original 36\u00a0hospitals, only nine are now partially\u00a0functional, all of them in the south.\n \n\"There are\u00a0no\u00a0functional\u00a0hospitals\u00a0left in the north.\"\n \nHospitals, protected under international humanitarian law, have repeatedly been hit by Israeli strikes in Gaza since the war erupted.\n \nThe Israeli military accuses Hamas of having tunnels under\u00a0hospitals\u00a0and using the medical facilities as command centres, a charge denied by the Islamist group.\n \nAsked about the charge, Mr Peeperkorn said \"we on our missions have not seen anything of this on the ground\", adding that WHO was \"not in a position to assert how any\u00a0hospital\u00a0is being used\".\n \nAlthough Wednesday's mission had aimed to deliver fuel, he said, the lack of security guarantees had meant they could only deliver medical supplies and medicines.\n \nBut that was not enough, he said.\n \n\"Without fuel, staff, and other essential needs, medicines won't make a difference and all patients will die slowly and painfully.\"\n \nAl Ahli, he said, still counts around 10 staff striving to provide basic first aid, while around 80 patients are sheltering in a church within the\u00a0hospital\u00a0grounds and the orthopaedic section.\n \n'TOO LATE'\n \nMr Sean Casey, a WHO Emergency Medical Teams coordinator who was on the mission, described \"unbelievable conditions\".\n \nAt Al Ahli, the team had walked through the courtyard, where bodies wrapped in white plastic sheeting piled up, and with automatic gunfire sounding nearby, he told journalists, speaking from Rafah in southern Gaza.\n \nIn the church, \"we found a really unbearable scene,\" Mr Casey said, describing around 30 patients, including young children and some with serious trauma wounds begging, not for care but for water.\n \n\"At the moment, it is a place where people are waiting to die.\"\n \nHe reiterated the increasingly urgent call for a ceasefire to allow sufficient amounts of aid in and also to evacuate more patients from Gaza.\n \nAsked when whether time was running out, he said: \"I think it is (already) too late.\n \n\"We are dealing with starving adults, children... Everywhere we go, people are asking us for food,\" he said.\n \n\"Even in the\u00a0hospitals, ... people with open, bleeding fractures, they ask for food.\n \n\"If that is not an indicator of the desperation, I don't know what is.\" AFP", "rights": "todayonline.com", "rank": 5307, "topic": "world", "country": "SG", "language": "en", "authors": "TODAY", "media": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--zGmJlMx9--/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mediacorp/tdy/image/2023/12/22/20231222-afp-gaza_hospital.jpg?itok=dJLDt98e", "is_opinion": false, "twitter_account": "TODAY", "_score": 4.657263, "_id": "13128ae98433dba54f4f8fc6253da7f7"}, {"title": "8 benefits areas HR is focusing on in 2024", "author": "HRM Asia Newsroom", "published_date": "2023-12-22 00:35:00", "published_date_precision": "full", "link": "https://hrmasia.com/8-benefits-areas-hr-is-focusing-on-in-2024/", "clean_url": "hrmasia.com", "excerpt": "What are some aspects of employee benefits that CHROs and HR leaders should look into and invest in the year ahead?", "summary": "As employers look ahead to 2024, the labour market does not appear to be easing much, meaning talent acquisition and retention will not get any easier for HR leaders. However, experts say that traditional and newer benefits can play a critical role in helping attract and retain top candidates and employees.\n\n\nFrom mental health and financial wellness to covering\u00a0menopause benefits\u00a0and weight loss drugs, both familiar and emerging benefits will remain critical to HR strategy, said Julie Stich, Vice-President of Content at the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans.\n\n\n'If you've got people who are productive and they're skilled and bring the skills you need and want, you'll want to keep them\u2014and benefits is one way to do that,' Stich told\u00a0\nHRE\n.\n\n\nHere are eight benefits trends to watch in the year ahead.\n\n\nMenopause benefits\n\n\nAn increasing number of employers are considering adding menopause benefits to their offerings, Stich said. With 75% of American women in their 40s and 50s working, the sometimes debilitating impact of menopause\u2014including such symptoms as brain fog, low energy, sleep disruption and hot flashes\u2014likely affects most workplaces in the US.\n\n\nCurrently, only\u00a04% of US employers offer menopause accommodations, but that figure is expected to soar to 33% within the next five years, according to benefits consultant NFP. More employees are seeking support, Stich said, for benefits that can include a quiet room to rest, a desk fan, flexible schedules or paid time off.\n\n\nSoftware giant Microsoft and biotech titan Genentech are among the industry stalwarts already offering menopause benefits.\n\n\nWeight loss drug coverage\n\n\nOzempic and similar drugs prescribed for weight loss have been a hot topic with employers all year and likely will remain that way in 2024, said Stich.\n\n\n'The cost is not cheap for this particular coverage, but employers are comparing that with some of the comorbidities tied to obesity like hypertension, heart disease and some type 2 diabetes,' Stich said. 'They're also considering the demand that they're hearing from their employees who want access to these drugs.'\n\n\n49% of large employers\u00a0expect to cover the glucagon-like peptide (GLP) semaglutide weight loss medications as part of their 2024 health plans, up from 46% in 2023, according to a recent survey by the Business Group on Health.\n\n\nPersonalis\ned benefits\n\n\nPersonalised benefits, specifically voluntary benefits and lifestyle spending accounts, are on the rise as employers seek to connect with employees who 'want to feel they belong and are valued,' Stich said.\n\n\nVoluntary benefits include pet insurance and access to legal services, for example. Demand for both has\u00a0soared\u00a0in recent years.\n\n\nWith newer lifestyle savings accounts, which are employer-funded, employees can tap into the account to purchase a variety of items or services that employers deem eligible, such as athletic shoes or sessions with a debt management consultant. Currently offered by about 13% of employers,\u00a0lifestyle spending accounts (LSAs) are being considered\u00a0as additions by 70% of employers, according to a recent Mercer blog post.\n\n\nPrecision medicine\n\n\nPrecision medicine, also known as personalised care, is increasing as employees and their providers seek better and more detailed information for anticipating and treating a variety of illnesses. A survey from the Business Group on Health shows that 44% of employers plan to offer some form of precision medicine coverage in 2024.\n\n\nFor example, 31% of employers will cover genomic tests to find the best cancer treatment for an individual patient, said Brenna Shebel, Vice-President at the Business Group on Health.\n\n\nCaregiving benefits\n\n\nMany employees are seeking assistance caring for children, parents and, in some cases, grandparents, Stich said. This support ranges from flexible work options to paid time off and access to emergency caregiving services.\n\n\nChild and elder care benefits soared 177% from 2020 to 2023, according to a Goldman Sachs\u00a0report,\u00a0and are expected to continue to rise.\n\n\n'Caregiving is an area that's been discussed quite a bit and will continue to be discussed into 2024,' said Stich.\n\n\nFamily-forming benefits\n\n\nAcross the globe, about one in six people are infertile, according to a World Health Organization\u00a0report,\u00a0a fact that can significantly affect workforce productivity. A\u00a0survey\u00a0by fertility care company Carrot found that nearly three-quarters (74%) of affected employees have researched the condition and treatment while at work, and even more (77%) indicate they would stay at their employer longer if they offered support for fertility treatments.\n\n\nStich said employers are responding, increasingly offering fertility and surrogacy benefits and adoption assistance. Other related benefits also are on the rise, she said, including access to lactation consulting services and products and egg harvesting and freezing.\n\n\nMental health benefits\n\n\nSince spiking early in the COVID pandemic, demand for mental health services has not abated and instead continues to rise, Stich said. For instance, 83% of therapists surveyed by Grow Therapy said\u00a0the number of patients seeking help for the first time increased this year.\n\n\nAs a result, 63% of employers are focusing on enhancing mental health and emotional wellbeing programs in 2024, according to WTW's\u00a02023 Best Practices in Healthcare Survey.\n\n\nWhile employers are signalling they will enhance their mental health benefits, Stich said, they will have to contend with challenges. For instance, she said, there are 'not enough providers in the mental health world,' and employees continue to struggle to get timely access to care when they need it.\nREAD MORE:\u00a0\n\u2018The year of efficiency': Industry leaders forecast 2024 HR trends", "rights": "hrmasia.com", "rank": 186821, "topic": "science", "country": "SG", "language": "en", "authors": "HRM Asia Newsroom", "media": "https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/10783411_m.jpg", "is_opinion": false, "twitter_account": null, "_score": 4.6135955, "_id": "a001dafe5de3440bef906e686db25f08"}, {"title": "Israel bombards northern and southern Gaza, many reported dead", "author": "CNA", "published_date": "2023-12-16 14:02:42", "published_date_precision": "full", "link": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/israel-bombards-northern-and-southern-gaza-many-reported-dead-3993831", "clean_url": "channelnewsasia.com", "excerpt": "CAIRO: Israeli forces bombarded targets across Gaza on Saturday (Dec 16) including a YMCA building, with dozens of Palestinians reported killed or wounded, despite a renewed US call to scale down the\u2026", "summary": "CAIRO: Israeli forces bombarded targets across Gaza on Saturday (Dec 16) including a YMCA building, with dozens of Palestinians reported killed or wounded, despite a renewed US call to scale down the campaign and focus on Hamas leaders.\n \nIn Khan Younis in the south, Palestinian health officials said the Nasser Hospital had received 20 Palestinians killed in air strikes overnight, in addition to dozens of wounded, including women and children.\n \nPalestinian health officials also said Israeli strikes on Gaza City in the north had hit the YMCA headquarters, which is sheltering hundreds of displaced people and reported several dead and wounded.\n \nThe official WAFA news agency said at least three dozen people had been killed in strikes on three houses in the Jabalia refugee camp, which health officials were unable to confirm. Gaza's health ministry has said Israel's ground offensive and the targeting of medical facilities have made it hard to gather information about casualties in northern Gaza.\n \nRescue workers believed some casualties remained buried under the rubble in some of those areas.\n \nGaza residents also reported intense overnight fighting and bombardment in Sheijaia, Sheikh Radwan, Zeitoun, Tuffah and Beit Hanoun in the north, and in the centre, east and north of Khan Younis.\n \n\"The Gaza Strip turned into a ball of fire overnight, we could hear explosions and gunshots echoing from all directions,\" Ahmed, 45, an electrician and father of six, told Reuters from a shelter in central Gaza.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nPresident Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, brought a message to Israel on Thursday and Friday to \nscale down the campaign\n and transition to more narrowly targeted operations against Hamas leaders, US officials said.\n \nDuring the visit, Israeli officials publicly emphasised that they would continue the war until they eradicate Hamas. Washington appeared to acknowledge disagreement, as Sullivan said the timing was under \"intensive discussion\" between the allies.\n \nAn Israeli military official said \nthree hostages killed mistakenly in Gaza by Israeli forces\n had been holding up a white flag, according to an initial inquiry.\n \nThe incident happened in an area of intense combat where Hamas militants operate in civilian attire and use deception tactics, the official said, but the hostages were fired upon against Israel's rules of engagement.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n People hold signs as they protest following an announcement by Israel's military that they had mistakenly killed three Israeli hostages being held in Gaza by Palestinian group Hamas, at a demonstration in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Dec 15, 2023.

It was unclear if the building was one of those that WAFA said had been hit.\n \nThe military also said it had killed militants holed up in two school buildings in Gaza City, and raided apartments in Khan Younis stocked with weapons, uncovering what it described as underground infrastructure used by Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza and that Israel has vowed to destroy.\n \n\"Every day the situation gets worse. Food gets less, water gets worse, only death, fear and destruction get greater,\" said Samira, 40, a mother of four, who is displaced in Rafah, near the southern border with Egypt.\n \n\"I can't handle the children anymore. They're terrified and so am I. Every night we think it might be our last night. The bombing doesn't stop,\" she told Reuters by phone.\n \nWith intense fighting across the Gaza Strip and aid organisations warning of a humanitarian catastrophe, the United States has said \nIsrael risks losing international support\n with \"indiscriminate\" air strikes.\n \nIn a\u00a0\nsurprise cross-border attack on Oct 7\n, Hamas militants rampaged through Israeli towns, killing 1,200 people and capturing 240 hostages. Israel's counterattack has killed close to 19,000 people, according to Gaza health authorities, with thousands more feared buried under rubble.\n \nCOMBAT INTENSIFIES\n \nCombat has intensified in the past two weeks since the collapse of a week-long truce that had allowed dozens of hostages to be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.\n \nIsraeli and Qatari officials were set to meet in Norway on Saturday in an effort to revive talks about the release of hostages in Gaza in return for a ceasefire and the freeing of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n \nIn signs of the wider ramifications of the conflict, Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthis said they had attacked the Israeli Red Sea resort of Eilat with a swarm of drones, one of several drone incidents reported in the region on Saturday.\n \nMost of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been driven from their homes over the past two months, many several times.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n A Palestinian holds a child as they look on at the site of an Israeli strike on a house, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, on Dec 16, 2023.

These days, it's one of the first symptoms about which prenatal and postpartum women are knowledgeable \u2013 and often fearful of.\n\nDRAM happens to the majority of women at the later stages of pregnancy, so it's not a 'disease' or 'malfunction' so much as a normal adaptation to a growing baby. That said, there are ways to strengthen and work the core to avoid sustained dysfunctional DRAM after delivery, as well as precautions to look out for if and when DRAM persists long after pregnancy ends.\n\nHere are some myths and facts about DRAM to help mums better prepare and manage their abdominal muscles during pregnancy and postpartum.\n\nMyth: Every woman gets diastasis recti at some point in pregnancy\n\nIt's true that about 60% of women report DRAM by the end of pregnancy, but it is not a unanimous fact. Pregnancies after age 35, pregnancies of multiples, being petite in stature, and having multiple pregnancies back-to-back can increase the incidence of DRAM, and about 40% of women who do experience it at the end of pregnancy will still have it at six months postpartum. No matter when or how your diastasis happens, it's worth visiting a women's health physiotherapist to assess your condition after delivery and before starting weight-bearing or loaded hip flexion/extension exercises.\n\nMyth: Working your core while pregnant will cause diastasis recti\n\nCredit: 123rf\n\nOne of the most persistent myths I face with even my fittest clients is the misunderstanding that starting a pregnancy journey means stopping core work altogether \u2013 when in fact, core work is foundational to safe prenatal fitness and strong postpartum recovery. Understanding the different elements that make up the 'core' \u2013 which include the transversus abdominus, rectus abdominus, obliques, lower back, glutes, and pelvic floor \u2013 and how they all function and fire during the trimesters of pregnancy is crucial to a balanced prenatal exercise program. Hiring a certified coach to help design workouts with safe core engagement and progressive modification is the best preventive step against diastasis recti.\n\nMyth: Any degree of separation in your abs means you have diastasis recti\n\nThough there's no single clinical definition for DRAM, the accepted standard is that more than 2 'finger widths' (about 2-2.7cm) is considered an abdominal diastasis (separation). That said, many postpartum health professionals concur that the depth and texture of the separation (deep and squishy being more problematic than shallow and firm), regardless of width, is a better indicator of its severity and persistence. If you're unsure whether your separation is a diagnosed DRAM or simply normal for your stage of recovery, consult a women's health physio (ideally around 6 weeks postpartum).\n\nFact: Diastasis recti is not always dysfunctional\n\nCredit: 123rf\n\nSome women with DRAM experience a visible coning or doming within their midsection during exercise after pregnancy, indicating a misallocation of intra-abdominal pressure and a lack of controllable tension in the abdominal muscles. If this sounds like you, discontinue the specific exercises causing the doming/coning and focus on eccentric (lengthening; tension-based) movements like heel slides rather than concentric (flex/release) movements like sit-ups. To that point, women who still have firmness and tension along the linea alba but are also diagnosed with DRAM may not have any health issues or related pelvic floor problems at all, which means it is merely more aesthetic than functionally problematic.\n\nFact: It is never too late to address your diastasis recti symptoms\n\nCredit: 123rf\n\nWhile it is true that seeing a women's health physio around 6 weeks postpartum can help develop an ideal treatment plan to best diagnose and treat immediate DRAM, it is never too late to address persistent DRAM symptoms such as urinary incontinence, poor core and pelvic stability, and lower back pain. These are often related to muscular weakness, inability to hold and release tension, and underuse, and are treatable with a progressive exercise program from a women's health physio or certified perinatal corrective exercise specialist.\n\nThe takeaway is that diastasis recti is common, not always dysfunctional, and highly treatable with a bit of work and an informed pregnancy recovery team on your side.\n\nAmanda Lim is a certified fitness & nutrition coach, perinatal specialist, and mother of two.

The enhancement comes amid rising demands for quality cleaning services, and growing manpower challenges in the cleaning sector. The changes will uplift public health standards in Singapore, as cleaning businesses deepen competencies, adopt productivity solutions, and create better employment opportunities.\n\n2 New requirements include bizSAFE certification and a minimum paid-up capital or net worth. The bizSAFE certification supports the national thrust in workplace safety and ensures that cleaning businesses inculcate a culture of workplace safety for its workforce. A minimum paid-up capital or net worth ensures that the cleaning businesses are committed and have the financial bandwidth to pay Progressive Wage Model wages and invest in equipment and/or new technologies. Service buyers will be able to make better informed decisions based on licence classification when procuring the cleaning services.\n\n\n\n3 Existing cleaning businesses that are unable to meet the new licensing requirements and do not qualify for Class 1 or 2 Licences can apply for a non-renewable Class 3 Licence. The Class 3 Licence will also serve a transitory function and provide additional two years for cleaning businesses to grow their capabilities without imposing any new requirements. More information on the revised cleaning business licensing framework can be found on go.gov.sg/cleaning-business-licence.\n\n\n\n4 The enhanced cleaning business licensing framework was introduced as part of the Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill in parliament on 9 January 2023 and passed on 6 February 2023 [2]. To ensure smooth transition towards the enhanced framework, NEA, together with key stakeholders and partner agencies engaged cleaning businesses via multiple channels including circulars, electronic direct mailers, and several rounds of industry engagement sessions to address queries from cleaning businesses.

This has to be enabled by unlocking the country's social capital and getting help from the private sector, in addition to mobilising government primary health services, to reach a far-flung population.\n\n'We have a 278 million population\u2026 almost half (of whom) are women,' the minister said.\n\nNew testing technology, which makes it possible to catch cervical cancer early, will be able to reduce mortality to below 30 per cent, he told this week's Asian Insider podcast by .\n\nMr Budi is drawing on his experience as former chief executive of Bank Mandiri, Indonesia's largest financial institution with a customer base of over 20 million, to get the message out to tens of millions of women to volunteer for tests and vaccinations.\n\nGlobally, in 2020 alone, there were more than 600,000 new cervical cancer cases and over 340,000 estimated deaths, based on World Health Organisation data.\n\nIn Indonesia, cervical cancer is the second most common female cancer after breast cancer, with 70 per cent of the patients diagnosed in advanced stages, when treatment is less effective.

I think it's a small, small minority.\n \n'I would say it is wrong to sell.

It's a hard thing to do, but this is something which we are working with our suppliers extremely closely,' Punj told the publication.\n \nRecognising Singapore's strong dedication to environmental sustainability, Tim Hortons is broadening its focus beyond just offering healthier options. Punj said Tim Hortons uses sustainable packaging materials and even uses sustainable palm oil in their kitchen.\n \n'In every single aspect of the restaurant, there is a sustainability piece to that,' Punj said.\n \nStanding out and stepping up\n \nTim Hortons' strategy in Singapore extends past simply providing healthier options for the health-conscious market. Acknowledging the high rate of coffee consumption in Singapore of more than 18 times a month, the brand is strategically opting not to compete directly with local coffee shops, rather, focusing on securing a position within the 'third place' Western coffee market.\n \n'The size of the piece is quite big as well. We think we can build a very successful business in Singapore,' Punj said.\n \n'Third places,' as described by sociologist Ray Oldenburg, are locations that facilitate social interaction, usually a public place people frequent. This often refers to places where people spend time aside from their homes (first place) or work (second place). Coffee shops and cafes with relaxed atmospheres are often called third-place locations.\n \n'Singapore is an interesting market. There are three very clear markets, the Central Business District (CBD), the heartland malls, and the tourist-specific malls like Sentosa and Orchard. We are looking at all these clusters and we intend to open 10 to 15 restaurants going forward,' Punj said.\n \nHe added that having a restaurant footprint is important for Tim Hortons because around 70% of their revenue comes from in-store sales, compared to takeaway and delivery which accounts for around 25%-30%.\n \n'We will continue to look at locations, which are the right size for us. We are not planning to open really massive restaurants at this point in time, because I think that's something which is not viable anymore.

Not only has India's healthcare system grown at a remarkable CAGR of 22% since 2016 but has also become a cogent example of how rapidly changing trends and dynamics have gone on to shape the industry landscape.\n\n\nThis burgeoning industry is poised to witness a substantial addition of $300 billion in market size through various new domains such as med tech, primary care, digital health, healthcare insurance, and diagnostics services and the evolution of AI/ML-driven business models in the next five years to support the strong growth in the traditional segment of pharma and healthcare delivery.\n\n\nThe flow of capital, combined with tailwinds from the growing Indian economy and changing consumer behaviours, has led to substantial growth in healthcare infra, the evolution of payor mechanisms, and the advent of technology in healthcare. These healthcare trends are becoming larger themes that will define investment themes for 2024 and beyond.\n\n\nEvolving healthcare investment themes\n\n\nThe infrastructure needed to support the nation's healthcare needs, especially in the tier-II/III cities of India, has historically been inadequate. India has been reportedly facing a shortage of 2 billion sq ft healthcare space and needs an additional 2.4 million beds to reach the globally recommended ratio of three beds per 1,000 people. However, the scarcity of healthcare real estate has also presented an opportunity for healthcare providers to expand their services into uncharted territories.\n\n\nIn the last two years, the Indian hospital industry has witnessed close to $4 billion in investments from private equity (PE) funds to help accelerate its expansion into new markets. Through PE/VC investments, hospital chains have kickstarted a trend of consolidating market share by acquiring smaller hospital chains and distressed brownfield assets, including in tier-II/III and below markets.\n\n\nThe healthcare services segment has seen increased focus on oncology services encompassing clinics, drug development, and therapeutic advancements. Themes that will gain investment prominence include robotic surgery technologies, transplants, and the use of AI/ML in diagnosing and precision surgeries.\n\n\nHigh growth, numerous exit opportunities, and robust returns have assuaged investors despite high CAPEX, thus making the expansionary inclination of hospital chains a notable investment theme in the coming year.\n\n\nThe pharma industry is prioritising quality and sustainable growth and organised scaled approaches. PE/VC investments are increasingly focusing on manufacturers following global good manufacturing practices (GMP) and manufacturing medicines which are accessible and affordable by all strata of people. This will lead to organising not just the pharma industry but ancillaries like packaging, excipients, and the ingredients sectors as well.\n\n\nPharma investment strategies, especially in the API space, shall focus on de-risking from China by developing alternative supply chains.\n\n\nThe barriers to operating in the regulated markets have meant that traditionally, this has remained a big company play. However, mid-sized growing pharmaceutical companies have found a niche in the emerging markets space. RoW (rest of world) markets (i.e., export markets ex USA, Japan, Western Europe) have provided an opportunity to players in the last few years, and this trend should continue.\n\n\nPharma generics focus on the lower tier market \u2013 both as a manufacturer as well as a distributor \u2014 though a differentiated business model could soon emerge as a key pharma industry trend.\n\n\nThe med tech sector has seen tremendous activity in 2023 with the new Indian Medical Devices Regulations focusing on innovation, quality, and local manufacturing. The investment theme shall pivot from the earlier Medtech Distribution Model towards manufacturing. This is evidenced by the fact that over $100 million worth of M&A deals happened in this space in the last 12 months alone.\n\n\nDiagnostics has evolved over time and has adopted a patient-centric approach. The sector is now penetrating lower-tier markets, and this provides a larger incentive for investments in the space. Preventive care has evolved from hospitals to labs, and now care-at-home models have started gaining prominence. Also, advanced diagnostics and non-invasive diagnostics will play a greater role in the years ahead.\n\n\nLack of infrastructure has traditionally been a hurdle in the healthcare industry's tryst with growth and accessibility. COVID leading to widespread digitisation has made people more comfortable with care-at-home models and telemedicine. As a result, asset-heavy healthcare sectors like diagnostic services have been adopting an asset-light tech-based approach.\n\n\nPoint-of-care services, facilitated by technological advancements, have revolutionised diagnostics and treatment delivery, making healthcare more patient-centric.\u00a0 Clinical access through technologies like teleradiology, tele ICU, and telepathology will provide greater access across the country. In the coming year, technology will enable traditionally asset-heavy businesses to become leaner, making sub-sectors like med-tech, AI/ML in healthcare, etc alluring choices for investors.\n\n\nChanging payor mechanisms\n\n\nThe sector has witnessed an evolution in its payor mechanisms due to changing consumer behaviour \u2014 prominently in the upper middle class. The onset of business models aided by widespread digitisation, fintech-based lending, and corporate wellness etc have opened doors for investments in relatively newer areas such as care-at-home, OPD insurance, value-based care etc.\n\n\nThe evolving payor mechanism in healthcare has aligned with the shift towards preventive care. Increasing health awareness has paved the way for numerous wellness and nutrition companies to beef up manufacturing. These sectors have latched on to the surging momentum driving preventive care and have begun to attract larger consolidated players such as pharma companies venturing into nutraceuticals and the entry of private insurers offering OPD insurance.\n\n\nPreventive care is a multiple market (typically 4-5x in volumes compared to hospitals). We expect preventive care to contribute much of the next $300-billion topline growth in the overall healthcare sector, largely driven by volumes.\n\n\nThis entry of private players coincides with a similar enthusiasm from the government to expand healthcare financing and assistance through various schemes like Ayushman Bharat and the PPP models in healthcare.\n\n\nThe Jan Dhan Yojana, aimed at financial inclusion, has significantly contributed to the penetration of insurance and banking services among marginalised sections, thus reducing the reliance on out-of-pocket expenditure.\n\n\nAayushman Bharat and the PMJAY and PPP models have emerged as game-changers by providing health insurance coverage to millions of vulnerable households and addressing affordability in this sector.\n\n\nIncreasingly, changing payor mechanisms have already begun to show results with the out-of-pocket expenditures declining from 70% to below 50% of the total health expenditure since 2005.\n\n\nPE/VC firms are reassured by the fact that the new players will get sufficient legroom to build their businesses and grow margins on the back of tailwinds in the sector.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nAs we stride into 2024, the Indian healthcare ecosystem stands at the precipice of transformation. By 2023, health insurance penetration surged to 48%, signifying a remarkable leap from previous years. This transformation not only augments affordability but fuels investor interest in tech-driven healthcare solutions, telemedicine, and innovative care models. As the Indian healthcare sector braces for exponential growth, the convergence of investment opportunities and evolving payor mechanisms promises a landscape ripe for both social impact and financial success.", "rights": "dealstreetasia.com", "rank": 21078, "topic": "news", "country": "SG", "language": "en", "authors": "Mayur Sirdesai", "media": "https://media.dealstreetasia.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_4424-e1683205552391.jpeg?fit=1000,641", "is_opinion": false, "twitter_account": "@dealstreetasia", "_score": 4.1367364, "_id": "615e6533651e10593c320cff703b93ae"}, {"title": "Spark NZ Offers Free Mobile Data, Hotspotting & Calling During Fixed Network Failures", "author": "Ray Sharma", "published_date": "2023-12-18 05:47:29", "published_date_precision": "full", "link": "https://www.thefastmode.com/technology-solutions/34303-spark-nz-offers-free-mobile-data-hotspotting-calling-during-fixed-network-failures", "clean_url": "thefastmode.com", "excerpt": "Spark NZ Offers Free Mobile Data, Hotspotting & Calling During Fixed Network Failures", "summary": "Spark broadband customers will now automatically receive 14GB of max speed data with hotspotting and unlimited NZ calls and texts on their Spark mobile when a fibre or copper network outage is impacting their home broadband connection, as well as proactive text notifications to keep them better informed of when it will be resolved.\n\nThe new service, called Outage Assist, aims to improve transparency around network outages and keep customers updated as technicians work to restore services, whilst ensuring they have plenty of mobile allowances to stay online and connected if their broadband is down.\n\nSpark is also offering all broadband customers access to a new dashboard when they log into their MySpark account, called \u2018My Broadband Health'.

'Additionally, NeuLine's at-home ambulatory EEG allows patients to be treated sooner, as the wait time for inpatient care may take weeks or months.'\n\nThe company adds that at-home testing typically has more accurate results, as the patient's anxiety is minimal due to them being in familiar surroundings. The test is painless and allows the patient to go about their normal activities.\n\nThe procedure is similar to a routine EEG. NeuLine's technician will place EG wires on the patient's head and attach them to a small, portable recording device. The device is also equipped with a video camera to keep track of the patient's daily activities. At the end of the 72-hour period, the technician removes the equipment, and the results are reviewed by NeuLine's board-certified neurologist and sent to the patient's healthcare provider.\n\nAmbulatory EEG tests can be used to diagnose several neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's, dementia, epilepsy, Parkinson's, post-traumatic stress syndrome, and traumatic brain injury. NeuLine encourages patients who have symptoms of these conditions and who have been identified as candidates for an EEG by their neurologist to schedule an appointment. The team emphasizes that prompt diagnosis and early treatment improve the outcomes for many of these conditions.\n\n'It was such a blessing to have Perrisha Scott as my tech for my 72-hour EEG,' said a satisfied patient. 'She was so kind and friendly. She put me at ease and answered all my questions on what to expect during the 72 hours. She made the whole experience much more pleasant and relaxing than I could have expected.'\n\nInterested parties can find more information by visiting https://neulinehealth.com/\n\nContact Info:\n\nName: Frank Gray III\n\nEmail: Send Email\n\nOrganization: NeuLine Health\n\nAddress: 1402 S Custer Rd Ste 302, McKinney, TX 75072, United States\n\nWebsite: https://neulinehealth.com/\n\n\n\nRelease ID: 89116826\n\nIn case of identifying any problems, concerns, or inaccuracies in the content shared in this press release, or if a press release needs to be taken down, we urge you to notify us immediately by contacting error@releasecontact.com.

Similarly, 32 patients were admitted to intensive care units in the past week, up from 23 the previous week and nine the week before.\n \nThe average daily hospitalised cases recorded are also the highest for the year. The 560 cases are up from 350 cases the previous week and 225 the week before that.\n \nThe vast majority of cases now come from the JN.1 strain\u00a0\u2013 classified by the World Health Organization as a 'variant of interest'\u00a0\u2013 though it is not more severe than other past variants.\u00a0\n \nInfectious diseases experts have also said the surge is due to various factors, including time between vaccinations, fewer people wearing masks, and an increase in travel during the school holidays that began last month.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs waiting times for hospital beds are also on the rise, some hospitals told CNA about their measures to avoid overcrowding at their emergency departments and how they are helping to improve staff well-being.\n \nA spokesperson from Tan Tock Seng Hospital said bed wait times and occupancy rates 'have been trending on the higher side in recent weeks', due to the surge in COVID-19 cases and more patients \u2013 especially elderly ones \u2013 requiring longer stays in the wards.\n \nSimilarly, Sengkang General Hospital said that wait times and admissions 'may take longer' due to a higher patient load.\n \nA spokesperson from Raffles Hospital, a private facility, said it saw more cases at its acute and critical care department as well as its clinics across  in late November and early December.\n \nMANPOWER CONSTRAINTS\n \nMs Dhaatchaayani, also an emergency department nurse at a public hospital, said that staff like herself are now more aware of how to protect themselves and contain COVID-19 through precautionary measures.\n \nNevertheless, she concurred with May that most emergency department patients currently do not require emergency care. These unnecessary visits 'risk compromising the standard of care' for other patients who genuinely need emergency assistance, she said.\n \nShe added: 'On top of treating patients, staff like us who work as frontliners are at risk for exposure.\u00a0\n \n'The risk for exposure leads us to fall ill, which constraints the overall manpower.'\n \nMay said that patients are still coming to the emergency department for minor injuries like back or toe pain, while some younger ones seek emergency treatment for symptoms like a high fever, runny nose or cough. They do not go to a GP clinic, citing reasons like clinics being closed or long queues there.\n \n'I asked these patients, \u2018Why you never go see GP doctors earlier?', because their fever and cough are like three to four days. They said they don't want and they prefer ED,' May added.\n \n'They should stay at home and can recover by themselves. Nowadays there are (telemedicine) platforms, so they can get MC from there and do consultations.'\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n File photo of an ambulance parked outside the accident and emergency department of a hospital. (Photo: AFP/Roslan Rahman) \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nJames (not his real name), an emergency physician of 10 years and who works at a public hospital, noted that it is a 'constant pattern' for some patients to visit the emergency department for minor conditions such as a cut or high fever due to a lack of options, especially after hours.\u00a0\n \nThe doctor's name has been changed as he is not authorised to speak to the media. All three healthcare workers declined to reveal to CNA the hospital they work at.\n \nJames said that while overnight or 24-hour clinics are an option, they might be too far away and cost just as much as going to the hospital.\n \nDespite patients coming in for non-emergency conditions, James said that he understands why they do so.\n \n'Let's say you have a child and she has a fever of 40\u00b0C at 1am. It's a minor condition which you can wait till the next day to go to the hospital or you can self-medicate,' he added.\u00a0\n \n'But would you (wait) or would you want to go see a doctor to just get some reassurance?'\n \nHe added that people generally take it well when told that they do not need to visit the hospital for their condition. However, there are some patients who 'take it very badly'.\n \n'It's like, \u2018This condition, it looks very mild to you but this feels very serious to me. So who are you to say that I shouldn't be coming to A&E (accident and emergency department)?'' James said.\u00a0\n \nAsked if the workload ever gets too much to handle, James said that healthcare staff like himself have come to accept that this is part of the service they provide.\u00a0\n \nHowever, he added that when staff fall sick due to COVID-19, it makes the operation staffing 'very hard to run' when they are seeing more patients with illnesses on a reduced capacity.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n The number of weekly COVID-19 infections in  has risen sharply in recent weeks, raising questions about health risks and booster vaccinations in this year-end festive period. We're in a better situation now than in 2020, says Duke-NUS Medical School's Ooi Eng Eong. \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nHospitals CNA spoke to urged those with mild to moderate symptoms to visit a GP clinic or polyclinic near their home.\n \n'For those who are unwell with symptoms of COVID-19 or other respiratory infections, we encourage them to visit their family doctor first to determine the severity of their condition instead of heading to the ED,' said Sengkang General Hospital.\n \n'This will avoid crowding at EDs so that we do not delay the delivery of urgent care to those who need it.'\n \nThe hospitals added that only those who experience severe COVID-19 symptoms such as shortness of breath or individuals with serious or life-threatening emergencies should visit the emergency department.\u00a0\n \nA spokesperson from Raffles Hospital highlighted that everyone could also do their part by practising good hygiene and taking necessary precautions.\u00a0\n \nThis includes wearing a mask when in crowded places, and doing an antigen rapid test (ART) test if they experience any COVID-19 symptoms such as fever or chills, sore throat, loss of sense of taste or smell, or headache.\n \nCOPING WITH SURGE IN CASES\n \nTo manage the increased number of patients in their emergency departments, some hospitals offer suitable patients the option to receive 'hospital-level care' while remaining at their homes.\u00a0\n \nSengkang General Hospital told CNA that patients assessed to have stable medical conditions could have their treatment started promptly at the emergency department and subsequently continued at home.\n \nA spokesperson for the National University Health System (NUHS) also noted that alternative arrangements such as teleconsultation, tele-rehabilitation and monitoring, and delivery of medicines can be provided where clinically appropriate.\u00a0\n \nNUHS manages the National University Hospital, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Jurong Community Hospital and Alexandra Hospital.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nOver at  General Hospital, suitable patients may also be transferred from the emergency department and inpatient wards to Outram Community Hospital or Transitional Care Facilities for step-down care.\n \nIn addition, more\n \nelective inpatient surgeries are being done as day surgeries, said Associate Professor Lee Haur Yueh, acting chairman of  General Hospital's medicine division.\u00a0\n \n'Some patients are cared for in a short-stay ward where they are monitored for less than 24 hours after the surgery. This initiative helps to free up hospital beds for acute admissions from ED,' Assoc Prof Lee added.\u00a0\n \n'Rescheduling of elective care is only done after careful deliberation by the clinical team to ensure that the clinical condition of the patients safely allows for that.\"\n \nPatients at Sengkang General Hospital are discharged earlier at 11.30am instead of 1pm, which increases the number of beds available and reduces the long bed waiting time at the emergency department.\u00a0\n \n'For patients who might experience a longer wait time to be transferred to the ward, the specialty doctor from the inpatient team would have already started care management within the ED,' the hospital said.\n \nMeanwhile, NUHS said that it is deploying surge capacity in its hospitals' inpatient facilities such as the intensive care and isolation units.\u00a0\n \nThe spokesperson for the healthcare cluster added that it is also working closely with MOH on contingency planning, including ensuring sufficient manpower and deferring non-urgent elective operations to maximise bed capacity for urgent cases in need of acute care.\n \n'Where necessary, we are redeploying and increasing our manpower to better support high attendance at our EDs,' said the spokesperson.\u00a0\n \n'Our triage process includes having a senior emergency physician review the cases for admission to the hospital to ensure appropriate right-siting and avoid unnecessary admission.'\n \nSome hospitals also highlighted that they already have measures in place to deal with the surge. For Tan Tock Seng Hospital, these include optimising extended facilities at their emergency department and wards, as well as arrangements with community partners to ensure continued care for the patients.\n \nThe hospital's spokesperson said: '(Patients) needing immediate life-threatening intervention are treated first, while those with minor ailments would have to wait.'\n \nFor patients who are waiting for ward beds to be available, the hospital's care teams will review and begin treatment at the emergency department itself so that specialist care starts early.\n \nLikewise, Raffles Hospital said that it has established protocols for dealing with COVID-19.\n \n'(We) are experienced in dealing with a situation where numbers (have) increased,' said the spokesperson.\n \n'In line with protocols, we have been triaging patients during registration. We will prioritise and attend to patients who require urgent care.'\n \nApart from measures to manage patients, some of the hospitals CNA spoke to are also taking care of their staff.\n \nThe NUHS spokesperson said that initiatives have been rolled out since the start of COVID-19 to support the mental welfare of hospital staff. This includes resilience workgroups to strengthen their mental health and a well-being office that offers walk-in counselling services.\u00a0\n \nTan Tock Seng Hospital also pointed out that its staff are 'busier than usual' across its emergency department and all wards, and that support and well-being measures are in place to help them cope during this period.\u00a0\n \n'We are working hard to augment more staff to better support the current surge.'\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n COVID-19 \n \n hospital \n \n emergency", "rights": "channelnewsasia.com", "rank": 1591, "topic": "news", "country": "SG", "language": "en", "authors": "Louisa Tang,Natasha Ganesan", "media": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--_isR4GML--/c_crop,h_843,w_1500,x_0,y_105/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2021-08:cna,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2023/05/03/sya_9444.jpg?itok=XJCpMeZk", "is_opinion": false, "twitter_account": "@ChannelNewsAsia", "_score": 4.03547, "_id": "733f161a61b5cda4b7143111a3b8e665"}, {"title": "BuyEnov Unveils the Long-Term Safety and Efficacy Profile of SaNOtize Nasal Spray: Key Insights Revealed, Business News", "author": "Israel", "published_date": "2023-12-21 16:00:00", "published_date_precision": "full", "link": "https://www.asiaone.com/business/buyenov-unveils-long-term-safety-and-efficacy-profile-sanotize-nasal-spray-key-insights", "clean_url": "asiaone.com", "excerpt": "SaNOtize Nasal Spray: Revolutionizing Health Defense with Groundbreaking Nitric Oxide Technology.

The number of cases had jumped to 56,043 from 32,035 over the same period.\n \nDr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease physician at Rophi Clinic, added that while the new strain may not be any more severe, it is \"just as miserable\" for those who are infected.\n \n\"For those who have not been infected for a long time it tends to be more uncomfortable,\" he said.\n \n\"For many elderly and those at risk, the next attack can be as miserable or as\n \nserious as the last one.\"\n \nWHY IS JN.1 SO TRANSMISSIBLE?\n \nDr Tambyah said 's Covid-19 case spike is most likely fueled by the evolution of the coronavirus.\n \n\"This is known to happen with influenza and common cold (rhinovirus) viruses,\" he said.\n \n\"The reality is that these viruses are well adapted to avoiding the human immune system... most viruses that have adapted well to humans are constantly evolving to avoid the immune response generated by infection or vaccination.\"\n \nInertia in keeping up-to-date with Covid-19 vaccinations and the growing time since a previous infection have also resulted in the increasing number of Covid-19 cases, the experts said.\n \nDr Leong said: \"In both these cases, the longer it has been, the more likely they will fall sick (because of) the relative lack of immunity.\n \n\"Even though there is hybrid immunity, it is not sufficient for this strain because of the multiple mutations since.\"\n \nHybrid immunity is a combination of the effects of previous infections and vaccination, which provides stronger immunity against subsequent infections.\n \nDr Tambyah added that while it is not clear if the current Covid-19 vaccines are effective against JN.1, he noted that WHO has said that protections from vaccines to fight the Omicron XBB variant \"are likely to be effective\".\n \nWHO added in its Tuesday statement that its technical advisory groups are monitoring this.\n \n\"Certainly if the vaccine uptake was much better\u00a0\u2014 like in earlier vaccination rounds \u2014 we would see much fewer cases and less hospital admissions,\" said Dr Leong.\n \nMOH considers the minimum protection for persons five years and older as three doses of Pfizer-BioNTech (Comirnaty), Moderna-Spikevax or Novavax (Nuvaxovid) vaccines, or four doses of Sinovac.\n \nAccording to the ministry's website, it recommends an additional dose of the updated vaccine a year after their last dose for people aged 60 years old and above, those who are medically vulnerable and residents of aged care facilities.\n \nWHAT OTHER FACTORS ARE FUELLING THE COVID-19 CASE SPIKE IN SINGAPORE?\n \nExperts told TODAY that besides the new variant, winter conditions in the northern hemisphere and more opting not to wear masks\n\u00a0\nhave fueled the increase in Covid-19 cases.\n \nDr Leong said that more Covid-19 cases might be recorded as people are getting more than one viral infection at once as well.\n \n\"People are more symptomatic because they may be positive for Covid-19, but have another viral infection in the background that is not diagnosed,\" he explained.\n \nWith a more severe illness, people are more likely to see a doctor or be admitted to hospital. This would cause the recorded number of cases to rise.\n \nIncreased travel is also another factor, said Dr Tambyah, as travel helps mix and spread different virus strains that have developed in different locations.\n \nOn this point, Dr Leong added that this is like any epidemic, where cities and countries better connected with the rest of the world will be the earliest to be hit with an upswing of Covid-19 cases.", "rights": "todayonline.com", "rank": 5307, "topic": "news", "country": "SG", "language": "en", "authors": "Loraine Lee", "media": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--yCVVvJGp--/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mediacorp/tdy/image/2023/12/20/fusion-medical-animation-eaggqoiddmg-unsplash.jpg?itok=zJMO0gOW", "is_opinion": false, "twitter_account": "@TODAYonline", "_score": 3.959638, "_id": "5a5aa4d90ec890774032032abb3cbe11"}, {"title": "IFF Expands Partnership with Kemira to Commercialize New Designed Enzymatic Biomaterials, Business News", "author": "", "published_date": "2023-12-19 15:00:00", "published_date_precision": "full", "link": "https://www.asiaone.com/business/iff-expands-partnership-kemira-commercialize-new-designed-enzymatic-biomaterials", "clean_url": "asiaone.com", "excerpt": "High-performance biopolymers will soon be available for use at industrial scale, contributing to a more circular economy with new renewable materials WILMINGTON, Del., Dec. 19, 2023 /PRNewswire/ --\u2026", "summary": "High-performance biopolymers will soon be available for use at industrial scale, contributing to a more circular economy with new renewable materials\n \nWILMINGTON, Del.\n, \nDec. 19, 2023\n /PRNewswire/ -- IFF (NYSE:IFF) and Kemira today announced their next step in the collaboration to commercialize a portfolio of unique, renewable polymers derived from IFF's cutting-edge Designed Enzymatic Biomaterials (DEB) technology platform.

This often refers to places where people spend time aside from their homes (first place) or work (second place). Coffee shops and cafes with relaxed atmospheres are often called third-place locations.\n \nTim Hortons Singapore CEO Vaibhav Punj said that capturing this market is better than competing directly with koptiams, new age cafes and coffee roasters, and a recent spike of grab-and-go coffee concepts who just entered the market.\n \n'The size of the piece is quite big as well. We think we can build a very successful business in Singapore,' Punj said.\n \n'Singapore is an interesting market. There are three very clear markets, the Central Business District (CBD), the heartland malls, and the tourist-specific malls like Sentosa and Orchard. We are looking at all these clusters and we intend to open 10 to 15 restaurants going forward,' Punj said.\n \nHe added that having a restaurant footprint is important for Tim Hortons because around 70% of their revenue comes from in-store sales, compared to takeaway and delivery which accounts for around 25%-30%.\n \n'We will continue to look at locations, which are the right size for us.

With a commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 5, which focuses on gender equality, Nepal is making strides in women's empowerment. Ranked 99th out of 166 countries in sustainable development, the nation has shown progress, endorsing the Gender Equality Policy 2077 through the Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizens. This policy emphasises women's economic empowerment, participation in society and eliminating gender-based violence. Additionally, the Provincial and Local Governance Support Programme's Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Strategy further details approaches for mainstreaming gender and social inclusion, enhancing institutional capacities to promote these values at provincial and local levels.\n\nSelected gender indicators\n\nThe journey towards gender parity in Nepal is far from complete. The educational divide persists, with women receiving only 66.9 percent of the mean years of education compared to men in 2021. The gender gap in labour force participation is stark, with only 28.6 percent of women compared to 53.1 percent of men participating in 2022. Compared with labour force participation in the lower-middle income group, the gap between men and women is lower in Nepal. This gap is compounded by the high rate of vulnerable employment among women (90 percent in 2020 and 2021), far exceeding men's rate and surpassing regional averages (67.3 percent in 2020).\n\nSuch vulnerability places women at a greater risk of poverty; moreover, there is a lack of women's representation in data concerning unpaid domestic and care work. Maternal health shows good progress; maternal mortality decreased from 504 per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 174 in 2020, still above the regional average (138). Additionally, adolescent fertility rates have declined but remain high, with 64 births per 1,000 girls aged 15-19 in 2021, indicating ongoing reproductive health issues. Despite this progress, women's political representation is positive, holding 33.1 percent of parliamentary seats, consistent since 2010 and above the average for South Asia (18.2 percent) and lower-income countries (21.8 percent). Recently, Nepal also became the first South Asian country to register queer marriage.\n\nGender gap\n\nThe World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report 2023 indicates a protracted journey towards gender parity, estimating 131 years to close the global gender gap. The 17th iteration of the report benchmarks 146 countries across four dimensions: Economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival and political empowerment. South Asia, with a gender parity score of 63.4 percent, is the second-lowest among eight regions, improving by 1.1 points since the last edition. This progress is attributed to countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Bhutan, each improving by at least 0.5 points. However, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Nepal have seen declines in gender parity.\n\nIn Nepal, the Gender Gap Index score fell from 0.692 in 2022 to 0.659 in 2023, dropping its rank from 96th to 116th. Economic participation and opportunity saw a significant decrease, from a score of 0.641 to 0.476, plummeting Nepal's rank from 98th to 136th. Educational attainment slightly decreased from 0.916 to 0.918, with a rank fall from 125th to 127th. Health and survival improved, from a score of 0.965 to 0.969 and a rank from 109th to 82nd. However, political empowerment experienced a decrease in score from 0.247 to 0.276, with a decline in rank from 58th to 54th. Nepal's widening gender gap, particularly in economic participation and opportunity, highlights the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which exacerbated gender inequalities. The pandemic led to job losses or reduced working hours for 1.6 to 2 million Nepali female workers, alongside significant wage reductions across various sectors.\n\nClimate change and gender\n\nClimate change and gender inequality are closely linked, necessitating urgent structural changes. The International Labour Organization highlights that global warming puts 1.2 billion jobs at risk, disproportionately affecting women, especially in climate-vulnerable sectors. Women and girls disproportionately suffer the impacts of climate change due to their greater reliance on natural resources and primary roles in securing food, water and fuel. Climate-induced disruptions exacerbate these vulnerabilities, leading to increased risks of gender-based violence, health issues and further economic marginalisation, especially in disadvantaged communities. Concurrently, the correlation between the Gender Gap Index and GDP underscores that enhancing female participation in education and the workforce is vital for economic growth. In Nepal, women play a crucial role in sectors like agriculture, forestry and water management, so the transition to a green economy must be inclusive, considering women's unique challenges.\n\nUN Women's study 'Impact of Climate Change on Gender in Asia-Pacific' further illuminates the nexus of climate change and gender equality. For Nepal and similar countries, its findings are particularly relevant. Climate-related factors like temperature changes, precipitation variability and biodiversity loss significantly impact women's lives, primarily because they are often more dependent on natural resources and less likely to own productive assets. Women's traditional roles of gathering food, collecting water and fetching fuel have become increasingly burdensome as climate change exacerbates resource scarcity. The same study reveals a strong correlation between climate variables and gender-related outcomes, including increased burdens in accessing clean water and fuel and heightened risks of child marriage and intimate partner violence.\n\nNepal absent in key initiative\n\nThe COP28 Gender-Responsive Just Transitions & Climate Action Partnership is at the forefront of the global dialogue on climate change and gender equality. The initiative, launched during COP28's gender equality day, marks a significant step towards integrating gender perspectives into climate action. Endorsed by over 60 countries, the partnership focuses on three core pillars: Improving data for transition planning, directing effective finance flows to climate-impacted regions and enhancing education and capacity building. While Nepal is not a part of this initiative, the partnership offers a valuable model for integrating gender considerations into climate policies and actions. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has highlighted the urgent climate issues affecting Nepal, particularly the impact of rising temperatures on mountains. However, Nepal's absence from the COP28 Gender-Responsive Just Transitions & Climate Action Partnership, a key initiative for integrating gender into climate policies, points to a significant gap in representing Nepal in global climate and gender strategy discourse, likely due to oversights by its policymakers and climate delegates. The relevance of such a partnership to Nepal cannot be overstated.\n\nTo effectively address gender disparities and climate change, Nepal needs systemic reforms, including legal rights for women in property and finance, improved healthcare access and increased formal labour opportunities.

The awards were distributed during a carnival at the F1 Pit Building from Dec 10 to 14.\n\n\nThe Instagram account claimed that over 100 frontline workers contacted them, including nurses, doctors, swabbers, and social workers, expressing disappointment at being overlooked. The letter, published on Monday, pleaded for recognition of their sacrifices and urged the MOH to clarify the nomination procedures.\n \nSee also\n\u00a0 \nUS nears 6 million cases of coronavirus\nMOH acknowledged that not all contributors to Singapore's battle against the pandemic received the medal. The ministry underscored that awards bestowed upon leaders and organizations represented collective efforts within teams, highlighting that the fight against COVID-19 was a 'whole-of-society' endeavour.\n\n\nMOH clarified that it aimed for maximum inclusivity during the medal conferral process, with no set quotas on the number of recipients. The ministry stated that eligibility criteria required sustained contributions during the pandemic, including managing public health crises, supporting frontline operations, and addressing the economic, supply chain, and social consequences of COVID-19.\n\n\nNominations were solicited from public and private healthcare institutions and industry partners from October of the previous year to March of the current year. The nominating institutions had to justify each nominee's exceptional contribution to managing the high workload imposed by the pandemic.\n\n\nThe list of awardees was initially published on May 31 in the Government Gazette and on the Prime Minister's Office website. Between then and the end of August, MOH disclosed that additional awardees from the healthcare sector were added, responding to appeals for inclusion 'in the spirit of being inclusive.' The exact number of additional awardees during this phase was not specified.\n \nSee also\n\u00a0 \n3 more seniors die from Covid-19; 120 new cases reported\nMOH concluded by expressing gratitude to everyone who contributed to Singapore's fight against the pandemic, acknowledging the collective effort that strengthened the nation's resilience.\n\n\nThe statement, however, has only served to fan the flames of criticism even further. Singaporeans responding to the ministry's response online called it 'tone-deaf'.\n\n\nPointing out that over 100,000 COVID-19 resilience medals were issued, and it was not as though they were limited to a certain number, critics questioned why awards were issued to overseeing leaders instead of those directly involved in COVID wards.\n\n\nOnline commenters, including Redditors, characterized the MOH's response as poorly executed, with some suggesting a need for a change in the ministry's public relations leadership.\n\n\nOne Redditor, u/Skane1982, said, 'Stop\u2026 stop doubling down.

In fact, where and how do you even begin? And once you do, how do you keep it going at a sustainable rate?\n\nThankfully, many inspiring people have already walked that fiery path and emerged unscathed to pass their hard-earned nuggets of wisdom to those keen to follow in their footsteps.\n\nStarting a business a way to become more economically empowered\n\nBeing your own boss certainly sounds like a dream as you can enjoy total control over your time and actions without needing to answer to a superior.\n\n70% of survey respondents certainly think so, according to the latest Asia-Pacific (APAC) Economic Empowerment Report by Herbalife. They believe that one can become economically empowered by starting a business or a freelance side gig.\n\nThe survey defines economic empowerment as having the education, training, and skills to find a job, earn an income, and become self-supporting.\n\nThe sentiment is particularly strong among Millennials and Gen Zs, with 74% and 71% respectively agreeing that 'starting my own business or freelance work feels like the only way to become economically empowered'.\n\nWhile this survey only involved participants from Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Vietnam, and the Philippines, the results are consistent with that of the 2021 Young Entrepreneurs Survey, which found that 72% of APAC Gen Zs and Millennials across eight countries, including Singapore, aspired to be entrepreneurs.\n\nHealth & wellness an exciting sector for entrepreneurs\n\nWith so many success stories from young entrepreneurs, such as the 12-year-old Australian millionaire who moved to Singapore after \u2018retiring' from her toy company, finding inspiration to set up your own company is easy.\n\nBut of course, running a business comes with loads of responsibilities and issues to consider.\n\nAthena Lee, co-founder and CEO of Singapore-based online animal clinic ZumVet, and Yi Chien Lim, CEO of Malaysian healthy meal delivery service Homey Nutrition, know this firsthand.\n\nThe two women spoke in a Herbalife Dialogue Series on health entrepreneurship, where they shared their thoughts and observations about the current state of the health and wellness sector, as well as its challenges and opportunities for entrepreneurs.\n\nMs Lim said that she noticed a rise in consumers prioritising their wellbeing and adopting healthier lifestyles and habits in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. This led to an increased demand for wellness products and services.\n\nStephen Conchie, Regional President of Asia Pacific and China at Herbalife, pointed out that such trends make it 'a pretty exciting sector to be in right now' for entrepreneurs.\n\nAgreeing with Mr Conchie's sentiment, Ms Lee added that taking a chance at setting up your own company is a lot easier now.\n\nTechnological advancements mean that starting an online store and reaching out to consumers via social media is easier than ever.\n\nCouple that with a strong appetite for e-commerce and digital services, and entrepreneurs have a conducive environment to grow their businesses.\n\nPassion & research important for entrepreneurs\n\nAs clich\u00e9 as it may sound, passion is truly a fuel that can ignite a spark and keep someone going, including in their entrepreneurial journey.\n\nCommitment is vital in the world of wellness because, as Ms Lim put it, it's 'actually a very, very long journey' about helping customers make consistent healthy lifestyle choices.\n\n'Passion plays a significant role in setting up a business because it can be a big motivation behind you so that you can empower more consumers in the long term,' she shared.\n\nBut no matter how much passion you have, a lot of research has to be done. After all, you would want to know as much as possible about the pool you're diving headfirst into.\n\n'As an aspiring entrepreneur, it's really imperative that you have a strong understanding of the industry,' said Ms Lee.\n\nAnd no, watching a Netflix documentary or reading a few books will not suddenly turn you into an expert \u2013 the more hands-on your understanding is, the better.\n\nThis could mean trying items from different brands, having conversations with people you see as potential customers, or even working somewhere that sells the same things you plan to offer.\n\nThat way, you'll equip yourself with enough knowledge and experience to discover a problem and, hopefully, enough clarity on how your business can solve it.\n\nFor instance, Ms Lim saw a gap in the healthcare industry while working as a clinical dietitian, where she noticed most patients going to the hospital for a cure but not focusing much on prevention.\n\nShe then questioned how she could add value to the market, and so Homey Nutrition, which delivers personalised meals according to customers' health needs, was born.\n\nResilience key to overcoming challenges\n\nAt the same time, aspiring entrepreneurs should be prepared to face struggles along the way \u2013 something that even business titans like Steve Jobs and Richard Branson had to endure.\n\nWhile challenges come in many different forms, Ms Lee said that they generally boil down to two main ones: managing your time and resources.\n\nIn healthcare, these can be trickier due to hurdles like stakeholders who are resistant to change, long sales cycles and numerous regulations, among others.\n\nThings don't get easier the bigger your business gets \u2013 in fact, it gets tougher.\n\n'When your business grows, people demand more and they want convenience,' said Ms Lim. Because of this, having a seamless logistics management system is very important to her.\n\nMs Lee also named resilience as a crucial trait \u2013 even more crucial than passion, in fact \u2013 for an entrepreneur to have.\n\n'At the end of the day, it's not always going to be a bed of roses, right? You are going to have challenges and things will get difficult for sure.'\n\nIn addition, Mr Conchie advocates adopting the right mindset and having a strong support network and adopting the right mindset.\n\n'If I think about the entrepreneurs I have the pleasure of working with, the ones who are truly successful are those with the mindset of overcoming challenges and looking for the learning in the challenge.'\n\nEvery difficulty brings an opportunity to move forward. It can be a lonely road to be an entrepreneur, and having supportive people who understand the journey you want can be very helpful.\n\nLook out for full Herbalife Dialogue Series in January\n\nAll these insightful tips are just snippets of what was discussed during the three-part Herbalife Dialogue Series, called \u2018Navigating a Future in Health Entrepreneurship'.\n\nThis year's talk is directed at new and inspiring entrepreneurs, especially Gen Zs and Millennials, who are keen on exploring the health and wellness landscape.\n\nFuture young bosses can learn more about what it takes to survive and thrive in the industry as well as useful pointers that may help them along the way.\n\nEven if you've never really given much thought to setting up your own business, you can still pick up pointers that would be useful to you in any other job or situation.\n\nThe full Herbalife Dialogue Series will be available online in January 2024.
